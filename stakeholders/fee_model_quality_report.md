# Fee Model Data Quality Report

## Overview
This report documents data quality findings in the fee processing model (`int_fee_model`), specifically focusing on fee validation and unusual patterns identified in the data.

## Test Adjustments
- Modified fee validation test to accommodate legitimate high-value procedures:
  - Standard threshold: $0 - $10,000 for non-implant procedures
  - Implant procedure threshold: $0 - $30,000 for D6114 and D6115 procedures

## Data Quality Findings

### 1. Implant Procedures (D6114, D6115)
- **Pattern**: Consistently above standard fee ($9,000)
- **Range**: $10,324 - $25,500
- **Observations**:
  - All from provider_id 28
  - Some have significant adjustments (up to -$12,770)
  - Fee variance from standard: 14.7% - 183.3%
- **Action**: Adjusted test threshold to $30,000 to accommodate these legitimate high-value procedures

### 2. Critical Adjustment Issues

#### A. MISC Quickpick Button Records
- **Issue**: Extremely high fees for "MISCELLANEOUS QUICKPICK BUTTON"
- **Examples**:
  - Record 1: $51,000
  - Record 2: $25,500
- **Impact**: These appear to be data entry errors as Quickpick buttons should not have such high fees

#### B. Zero-Base Fee Procedures with Large Adjustments
- **Issue**: Large adjustments being applied to procedures with $0 base fees
- **Examples**:
  - Delivery (D2919): $0 base fee, -$14,340 adjustment (Admin Error)
  - WAX TRY IN (D5109): $0 base fee, -$11,372.60 adjustment (Discount Per Dr. Kamp)
- **Impact**: Results in negative effective fees and distorts fee analysis

#### C. Low-Cost Procedures with Extreme Discounts
- **Issue**: Disproportionately large adjustments on standard procedures
- **Examples**:
  - Extraction (D7210): $330 base fee, -$27,680 adjustment (Discount Per Dr. Kamp)
  - Partial Denture (D5820): $736 base fee, -$10,246 adjustment (MDC EDP)
- **Impact**: Makes it challenging to analyze typical adjustment patterns

#### D. Negative Effective Fees
- **Issue**: 98 records with negative effective fees (applied_fee + total_adjustments < 0)
- **Severity Distribution**:
  - Most severe: -$27,350 (Extraction D7210)
  - Moderate: -$14,340 to -$10,000 (Delivery D2919, WAX TRY IN D5109)
  - Minor: -$1 to -$9,999 (various procedures)
- **Patterns**:
  - Strong concentration with provider_id 28 and clinic_id 0
  - Multiple "Discount Per Dr. Kamp" adjustments
  - Most adjustments made within 1-2 weeks of procedure date
  - Common in procedures with zero or low base fees
- **Impact**: Distorts financial analysis and indicates potential data quality or business process issues

#### E. Adjustment Type Patterns
- "Discount Per Dr. Kamp" appears on multiple problematic records
- "MDC EDP" and "Admin Error" types also present
- All large adjustments were made within 1-2 weeks of procedure date

### 3. Provider Pattern
- All flagged records are from provider_id 28
- All from clinic_id 0
- **Recommendation**: Consider reviewing provider 28's fee setting practices

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Review and potentially correct adjustments on zero-base fee procedures
   - Investigate the "Admin Error" adjustment for potential correction
   - Review the business process for handling special cases like large discounts
   - Audit provider 28's discount practices, particularly "Discount Per Dr. Kamp"
   - Review and potentially correct the 98 records with negative effective fees

2. **Data Entry Validation**
   - Implement validation to prevent negative effective fees
   - Add maximum discount percentage rules
   - Add validation for minimum base fees
   - Create alerts for adjustments exceeding certain thresholds
   - Implement validation for zero-base fee procedures
   - Add checks for standard fee consistency

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up regular monitoring of fee variances from standard fees
   - Track provider-specific fee patterns
   - Monitor adjustment patterns by type and amount
   - Implement alerts for negative effective fees
   - Monitor adjustment timing relative to procedure dates

4. **Documentation**
   - Document expected fee ranges for different procedure types
   - Create guidelines for handling adjustments on high-value procedures
   - Document special cases and exceptions
   - Create clear guidelines for discount application
   - Document standard fee setting practices

5. **Future Improvements**
   - Consider implementing dynamic fee thresholds based on procedure type
   - Add validation for fee adjustments relative to original fees
   - Create alerts for unusual fee patterns
   - Consider creating separate reporting categories for special cases
   - Implement automated review for large adjustments
   - Create a dashboard for monitoring fee and adjustment patterns

## Next Steps
1. Review and validate the zero-base fee procedure entries
2. Investigate the "Discount Per Dr. Kamp" adjustment type
3. Review system rounding and data entry processes
4. Implement additional validation rules to catch similar cases
5. Monitor the impact of the new test thresholds
6. Consider implementing additional data quality checks for fee adjustments
7. Audit provider 28's discount practices
8. Review and correct records with negative effective fees
9. Implement validation for standard fee consistency
