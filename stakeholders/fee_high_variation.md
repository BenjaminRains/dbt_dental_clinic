# Fee Schedule Variation Analysis Update

## Summary
Analysis of fee schedule data has identified significant variations in procedure fees that require 
attention. We've identified 78 procedures with fee variations exceeding $500, with some showing 
extreme variations over $2,000.

## Key Findings

### 1. Critical Variations in Implant Procedures
**Extreme Variations (>$2,000 range)**
- **D6040 - Eposteal Implant**
  - Range: $6,021 (from $3,978 to $9,999)
  - Highest variation in the dataset
  - Requires immediate review of pricing strategy

- **D5725 - Rebase Hybrid**
  - Range: $3,404 (from $596 to $4,000)
  - Unusually wide spread for a rebase procedure
  - Lower bound may be incorrectly set

- **D6055 - Implant Connecting Bar**
  - Range: $2,390 (from $1,110 to $3,500)
  - Essential component for implant procedures
  - Significant price inconsistency

- **D6010 - Endosteal Implant**
  - Range: $2,018 (from $500 to $2,518)
  - Basic implant procedure with unexpected variation
  - Minimum fee appears too low for procedure complexity

### 2. Concerning Fee Patterns

**Zero-Fee Entries in Surgical Procedures**
- D7261 - Sinus Perforation Closure
- D7270 - Tooth Re-implantation
- D7272 - Tooth Transplantation
➤ These surgical procedures should never have zero-fee entries

**Inconsistent Crown Pricing**
- Implant Crowns (D6059-D6066): $250 - $1,900
- Basic Crowns (D2740): $126 - $1,288
➤ Wide variation suggests potential pricing strategy issues

**Diagnostic Procedure Variations**
- D0474-D0481 Range: $298 - $999
- Includes microscopy and tissue examination
➤ Should have more standardized pricing

### 3. Impact Assessment

**Financial Risk**
- Inconsistent pricing affects revenue predictability
- Zero-fee entries represent potential revenue loss
- Wide variations complicate insurance negotiations

**Operational Concerns**
- Difficult to provide accurate patient estimates
- Challenges in fee schedule maintenance
- Risk of undercharging for complex procedures

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Review and correct all zero-fee entries
   - Establish minimum fee thresholds for surgical procedures
   - Standardize implant-related procedure fees

2. **Process Improvements**
   - Implement procedure-specific fee ranges
   - Create validation rules for fee schedule updates
   - Regular audit of fee variations

3. **Policy Updates**
   - Define acceptable fee ranges by procedure type
   - Document justification requirements for fees outside standard ranges
   - Establish review process for fee schedule changes

## Next Steps
1. Schedule review meeting with clinical directors
2. Prioritize correction of zero-fee surgical procedures
3. Develop standardized fee ranges for implant procedures
4. Create automated alerts for fee variations exceeding thresholds
