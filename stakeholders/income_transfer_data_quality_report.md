## The Rules: How Transfers Should Work

### Income Transfer Rules
1. Income transfers must be $0 payments with offsetting splits:
   - Negative split (outgoing): **MUST** use unearned type 288
   - Positive split (incoming): **MUST** use unearned type 0
   - Total of all splits must sum to zero
2. Each transfer appears as "Txfr" code on patient accounts
3. Transfers affect income allocation but don't change total practice income

### System Requirements
1. **Allocations Setup:**
   - Paysplits should be set to "Rigorous" mode
   - Show Income Transfer Manager should be enabled
   - Claim Pay by Total splits should be enabled
2. **Permissions Required:**
   - PaymentCreate permission for income transfers
   - All transfers are logged in Audit Trail

## Examples

### ‚úÖ Correct Income Transfer
A properly configured income transfer pair should look like this:

1. **Outgoing Transfer:**
   - Payment Type: 0 (Administrative)
   - Amount: -$100.00 (negative)
   - Unearned Type: 288 ‚úÖ
   - Payment Notes: "INCOME TRANSFER"
   - Date: 2024-11-04

2. **Matching Incoming Transfer:**
   - Payment Type: 0 (Administrative)
   - Amount: +$100.00 (positive)
   - Unearned Type: 0 ‚úÖ
   - Payment Notes: "INCOME TRANSFER"
   - Date: 2024-11-04

### ‚ùå Incorrect Income Transfer
Common mistakes to fix:

1. **Outgoing Transfer (Wrong):**
   - Payment Type: 0 (Administrative)
   - Amount: -$100.00 (negative)
   - Unearned Type: 0 ‚ùå (WRONG - must be 288)
   - Payment Notes: "INCOME TRANSFER"
   - Date: 2024-11-04

2. **Matching Incoming Transfer (Wrong):**

## Impact if Not Fixed
These issues will affect:
- ‚ùå Financial reporting accuracy

## How to Fix: Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. System Setup Verification
1. Check Allocations Setup:
   - Verify Paysplits is set to "Rigorous"
   - Enable Show Income Transfer Manager
   - Enable Claim Pay by Total splits

### 2. Fix Process for Each Patient
1. Use Income Transfer Manager:
   - Access via Account Module > Payment dropdown
   - Review Provider/Family Balances section
   - Check Show Breakdown for detailed view

2. For each transfer pair:
   - Double-click transfer in Income Transfer Manager
   - For outgoing transfers (negative amounts): Change to type 288
   - For incoming transfers (positive amounts): Change to type 0
   - Verify amounts match and sum to zero

3. Verify your changes:
   - Check payment window
   - Verify paysplit allocations
   - Confirm unearned types are correct
   - Ensure transfers appear as "Txfr" in account

### Fix Priority Order
1. üî¥ Recent transfers first (October-November 2024)
   - Patient 22194: 182 transfers
   - Patient 884: 129 transfers
   - Patient 26793: 53 transfers

2. üü° High-volume patients (100+ transfers)
   - Any remaining patients with 100+ transfers

3. üü¢ Historical transfers (2020-2023)
   - Patient 8457: 235 transfers

## Detailed Analysis of Transfer Issues (November 2024)

### Pattern Analysis
Our recent analysis of 5,006 transfer records revealed distinct patterns of issues:

1. **Single Match with Correct Sign (1,839 records)**
   - **Pattern:** Transfers have correct unearned types but may have timing issues
   - **Example:**
     ```
     Patient 676 (Nov 4, 2024)
     - Outgoing: -$9.00, unearned_type=288 ‚úÖ
     - Incoming: +$9.00, unearned_type=0 ‚úÖ
     - Issue: Multiple duplicate pairs (12 matching pairs)
     ```

2. **Single Match with Wrong Sign (803 records)**
   - **Pattern:** Amount signs don't match unearned types
   - **Example:**
     ```
     Patient 1964 (Oct 31, 2024)
     - Outgoing: -$2.40, unearned_type=0 ‚ùå (should be 288)
     - Incoming: +$2.40, unearned_type=47 ‚ùå (should be 0)
     ```

3. **Multiple Matches (1,073 records)**
   - **Pattern:** Duplicate transfer entries causing confusion
   - **Example:**
     ```
     Patient 11961 (Oct 30, 2024)
     - Original: -$3.48, unearned_type=288
     - Duplicate 1: -$3.48, unearned_type=288
     - Duplicate 2: -$3.48, unearned_type=288
     - All with same incoming match
     ```

4. **No Matching Pairs (1,291 records)**
   - **Pattern:** Orphaned transfers without counterparts
   - **Example:**
     ```
     Patient 5927 (Nov 4, 2024)
     - Outgoing: -$160.45, unearned_type=0 ‚ùå
     - No matching incoming transfer found
