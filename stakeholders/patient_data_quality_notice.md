# Patient Data Quality Notice
**Date: 2025-04-15**  
**Priority: High**  
**Status: Active**

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Missing Critical Patient Information (21,686 Active Patients)
Three critical pieces of information are missing for the same set of 21,686 active patients:
- **Consent Forms**: Missing for legacy patients (first visits 1985-1997)
- **Emergency Contact Names**: Missing for the same patient group
- **Emergency Contact Phone Numbers**: Missing for the same patient group

**Impact**: 
- Compliance risk due to missing consent forms
- Patient safety risk due to missing emergency contacts
- Potential regulatory violations

**Action Required**:
- Collect consent forms at next patient visit
- Update emergency contact information
- Consider targeted outreach campaign
- Track collection progress in a separate system

### 2. Missing First Visit Dates (3,162 Patients)
- Approximately 2,000 active patients missing first visit dates
- Affects patient history tracking and analytics
- Critical for understanding patient relationships and treatment history

**Action Required**:
- Review active patients missing first visit dates
- Update first visit dates based on appointment history
- Ensure new patients get first visit date recorded

### 3. Missing Birth Dates (2,614 Patients)
- Affects age calculation (NULL ages)
- Most patients have first visits from 1990s or 2006
- Some records use placeholder date (1900-01-01)

**Action Required**:
- Collect birth date information at next visit
- Update age calculations once data is collected

## Other Data Quality Concerns

### 1. Historical Data Limitations
- 27,789 records missing creation timestamps (1985-2006)
- Use first_visit_date as approximate creation date for these records
- All new records after 2006 have proper timestamps

### 2. Provider Assignments
- 4,662 records have secondary_provider_id = 0
- Primarily affects prospective and inactive patients
- Review active patients with zero provider IDs

### 3. Contact Preferences
Current distributions need verification:
- Appointment confirmations: Email (58.52%), Text (26.26%), Phone (0.04%)
- General contact: Email (58.53%), Phone (28.08%), Text (0.01%)

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize collection of missing consent forms and emergency contacts
2. Implement tracking system for data collection progress
3. Review and update first visit dates for active patients
4. Verify contact preference mappings with stakeholders
5. Schedule follow-up review in 3 months
