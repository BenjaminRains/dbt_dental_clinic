## Potential Issues

### Data Quality Concerns
1. **Termination Date Accuracy**
   - All affected subscribers show termination dates in 2021-2022
   - Payments continue to be processed through 2024-2025
   - No benefit notes explaining the continued payments

2. **Carrier Name Consistency**
   - Some subscribers have payments under different carrier names
   - Example: Subscriber 11615 has payments under both "BCBS of IL" and "Blue Cross Blue Shield Of Illinois"

### Business Process Questions
1. **Payment Authorization**
   - How are payments being authorized for terminated subscribers?
   - Are there special cases where terminated subscribers should receive payments?
   - Is there a grace period after termination?

2. **Group Plan Considerations**
   - Some cases involve union/group plans (e.g., "Cement Masons` Local 502 Welfare Fund")
   - Do group plans have different termination rules?
