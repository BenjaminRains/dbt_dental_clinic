## 2. Fee Schedule Analysis
The practice maintains multiple fee schedules (8285-8293) that show significant variation from actual charges:

### Example: D4910 (Periodontal Maintenance)

## 3. Key Findings

### 3.1 Consistency in Charging
- The practice maintains fixed fees for procedures
- These fees are independent of fee schedule amounts
- Charges are consistent across different patients and dates

### 3.2 Fee Schedule Patterns
- Schedule 8293 often matches the actual charged amount
- Other schedules typically show lower amounts
- Some schedules (particularly for diagnostic codes) show $0
- Variation between schedules can be significant (up to 90% in some cases)

### 3.3 Out-of-Network Implications
- The consistent fee structure supports out-of-network status
- Fee schedules appear to be reference data only
- No evidence of fee adjustment based on insurance schedules

## 4. Recommendations

### 4.1 Data Model Updates
1. Add documentation about:
   - The primary role of `procedure_fee` in `procedurelog`
   - The reference-only nature of fee schedules
   - The relationship between fee schedules and insurance companies

2. Consider implementing:
   - Validation tests for consistent procedure fees
   - Alerts for significant deviations from standard fees
   - Documentation for each fee schedule's purpose

### 4.2 Business Process
1. Consider:
   - Archiving unused fee schedules
   - Documenting the rationale for maintaining multiple fee schedules
   - Creating a process for fee schedule updates

## 5. Next Steps
1. Review and validate findings with clinical team
2. Document any exceptions to standard fee structure
3. Consider implications for insurance processing
4. Update data models to reflect actual fee usage patterns
