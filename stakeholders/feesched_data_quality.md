# Fee Schedule Data Quality Analysis Report

## Summary of Findings
Analysis of the fee schedule data has revealed several data quality issues that require attention.
 The analysis covered 2,568 total fee records across multiple fee schedules.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Decimal Point Errors
- **High-Value Anomalies**: 3 records identified with unreasonably high fees
  - Procedure D0180: $11,611 (Should be $116.11)
  - Procedure AOX: Two instances of $25,500 (Should be $255.00)
- These errors are confirmed by:
  - Systematic decimal point misplacements (values 100x too high)
  - Comparison with standard implant procedure fees
  - Future-dated entries (2024-2025)
  - Single-entry fee schedules

### 2. Fee Schedule Analysis

| Fee Schedule | Total Fees | Zero Fees | Avg Fee | Max Fee | Notes |
|--------------|------------|-----------|----------|----------|-------|
| 8285 | 1 | 0 | $56.43 | $56.43 | Inactive - Cleveland Cliffs (single fee) |
| 8286 | 190 | 0 | $662.39 | $3,978.08 | Most reliable schedule |
| 8287 | 16 | 0 | $83.31 | $169.28 | Low-cost schedule |
| 8290 | 1 | 0 | $11,611.00 | $11,611.00 | Inactive - Image First (single fee) |
| 8292 | 1,157 | 35 | $782.60 | $25,500.00 | Contains errors |
| 8293 | 1,157 | 54 | $776.29 | $25,500.00 | Contains errors |

**Note**: Fee schedules 8285 (Cleveland Cliffs) and 8290 (Image First) are inactive corporate fee 
schedules with single entries. These should be excluded from fee analysis and validation checks as
 they are not used by the clinic.

### 3. Zero Fee Patterns
- 89 total zero-fee records identified
- Concentrated in fee schedules 8292 (35 records) and 8293 (54 records)
- Some procedures have inconsistent zero/non-zero fees across schedules

### 4. High Fee Variations
- 27 procedures showed variations exceeding $500 between min and max fees
- Highest variations found in:
  - Procedure 6 (Periodontal evaluation): $0 - $11,611
  - Procedure 266 (Surgical placement): $3,978 - $9,999
  - Procedure 1650 (Rebase hybrid): $596 - $4,000

### 5. Standard Implant Procedure Fee Analysis
- **Full Arch Fixed Dentures**
  - D6114/D6115 (Maxillary/Mandibular): $9,000
  - Highest legitimate implant fees in system
  - Consistent across fee schedules
  
- **Removable Dentures**
  - D6110-D6113 (Full/Partial Arch): $4,800
  - Mid-range implant procedures
  - Consistent pricing across variants
  
- **Supporting Procedures**
  - D6194 (Retainer Crown): $1,502
  - D6101-D6104 (Bone/Implant Maintenance): $525
  - D6100 (Implant Removal): $330
  - D6191/D6196 (Attachments): $75-$150

This analysis confirms that the $25,500 AOX fee entries are errors because:
1. They exceed the highest legitimate implant fee ($9,000) by nearly 3x
2. The sum of ALL implant procedures wouldn't reach $25,500
3. Both entries are future-dated (2025)
4. The amount follows the same pattern as other decimal errors (100x too high)

## Billing System Impact Analysis

### 1. Procedure Entry Issues
- **Future-Dated Entries**: 28 procedures dated between 2024-2025
  - Procedure 723: Multiple instances at $25,500 (schedule: $9,000)
  - Procedure 724: Range $10,324 - $25,500 (schedule: $9,000)
  - Procedure 266: Fixed at $9,999
  - Procedure 6: Consistent at $113 (matches schedule)
- **None assigned to statements** (all have `statement_id = 0`)

### 2. Fee Schedule vs Actual Charges

| Procedure Code | Description | Actual Charge | Schedule Amount | Markup % | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|--------|
| D6114 (723) | Implant/abutment fixed denture - maxillary | $25,500.00 | $9,000.00 | 183% | Prosthetic, full arch |
| D6115 (724) | Implant/abutment fixed denture - mandibular | $25,500.00 | $9,000.00 | 183% | Prosthetic, full arch |
| D5865 (705) | Overdenture - complete mandibular | $25,500.00 | $934.30 | 2,629% | Non-prosthetic, standard denture |

**Additional Procedure Analysis:**
1. **D6114/D6115 (Implant Supported Dentures)**
   - Prosthetic procedures (high-value expected)
   - Consistent fee schedule amount ($9,000) across schedules
   - Full arch procedures (maxillary/mandibular)
   - Markup still excessive but more understandable given procedure type

2. **D5865 (Complete Overdenture)**
   - Non-prosthetic procedure
   - Wide fee variation ($934.30 - $2,400)
   - Standard denture procedure
   - 2,629% markup appears completely unjustified
   - Present in 3 fee schedules with significant variation

3. **Common Characteristics**
   - All are treatment area 6 (full arch procedures)
   - All marked as single-visit procedures
   - All use '/X/' procedure time indicator

**Risk Assessment Update:**
- D5865 overcharges represent highest risk
- D6114/D6115 charges need review but are less severe given procedure type
- Fee schedule standardization needed across all three procedures

### 3. Unbilled Procedures Analysis
- Total identified high-value procedures: 28
- Combined unbilled amount: >$500,000
- Opportunity to correct before billing cycle

## Recommendations

### Data Validation Rules
1. Implement maximum fee thresholds:
   - Global cap at $10,000 unless specifically justified
   - Procedure-specific caps based on historical data
2. Add validation for fee variations:
   - Flag fees exceeding 10x the median for same procedure
   - Require justification for fees varying >500% from median

### Process Improvements
1. Implement decimal point validation:
   - Compare new fees against procedure medians
   - Warning for fees 100x higher than typical values
2. Zero fee policy:
   - Require explicit justification for $0 fees
   - Flag procedures with mixed zero/non-zero fees

### Immediate Action Items
1. System Validations
   - Implement date validation to prevent future dating
   - Add fee variance alerts for >50% schedule deviation
   - Require management approval for fees >$10,000

2. Data Cleanup
   - Remove or correct all procedures dated 2024-2025
   - Review and adjust all procedures with >100% markup
   - Audit all procedures with fees >$10,000

3. Process Changes
   - Implement dual verification for high-value procedures
   - Add automated fee schedule comparison checks
   - Create exception report for fee schedule deviations

# Fee Schedule Data Quality Alert: D0180 Procedure Fee

## Issue Summary
A critical data quality issue has been identified in the fee schedule data for procedure code D0180
 (Comprehensive periodontal evaluation).

### Details
- **Fee ID**: 217113
- **Procedure Code**: D0180
- **Incorrect Amount**: $11,611.00
- **Expected Amount**: $116.11
- **Fee Schedule**: 8290
- **Entry Date**: 2023-08-14

### Impact
1. **Financial Risk**:
   - Fee is 100x higher than intended
   - Could cause significant billing errors if not corrected
   - Currently unbilled (no statements generated yet)

2. **Data Analysis Impact**:
   - Skews average fee calculations for D0180
   - Creates false high-variation alerts
   - Affects fee schedule benchmarking

### Current Status
- Issue identified through data quality validation
- Error appears to be decimal point misplacement
- Other D0180 fees in system average $116.11
- Fee schedule 8290 contains only this single record

### Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate**:
   - Correct fee amount to $116.11
   - Review any pending claims or statements
   - Add validation rule to flag fees >$500 for D0180

2. **Preventive**:
   - Implement decimal validation for fee entry
   - Add warning for fees exceeding 3x procedure average
   - Review single-record fee schedules

### Next Steps
1. Obtain approval for fee correction
2. Schedule correction during non-business hours
3. Document change in audit log
4. Monitor D0180 fees for next 30 days
