# Fee Schedule Data Quality Analysis Report

## Summary of Findings
Analysis of the fee schedule data has revealed several data quality issues that require attention. The analysis covered 2,568 total fee records across multiple fee schedules.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Decimal Point Errors
- **High-Value Anomalies**: 3 records identified with unreasonably high fees
  - Procedure 6: $11,611 (Should be $116.11)
  - Procedure 1598: Two instances of $25,500 (Should be $255.00)
- These errors appear to be systematic decimal point misplacements (values 100x too high)

### 2. Fee Schedule Analysis

| Fee Schedule | Total Fees | Zero Fees | Avg Fee | Max Fee | Notes |
|--------------|------------|-----------|----------|----------|-------|
| 8286 | 190 | 0 | $662.39 | $3,978.08 | Most reliable schedule |
| 8287 | 16 | 0 | $83.31 | $169.28 | Low-cost schedule |
| 8290 | 1 | 0 | $11,611.00 | $11,611.00 | Problematic single record |
| 8292 | 1,157 | 35 | $782.60 | $25,500.00 | Contains errors |
| 8293 | 1,157 | 54 | $776.29 | $25,500.00 | Contains errors |

### 3. Zero Fee Patterns
- 89 total zero-fee records identified
- Concentrated in fee schedules 8292 (35 records) and 8293 (54 records)
- Some procedures have inconsistent zero/non-zero fees across schedules

### 4. High Fee Variations
- 27 procedures showed variations exceeding $500 between min and max fees
- Highest variations found in:
  - Procedure 6 (Periodontal evaluation): $0 - $11,611
  - Procedure 266 (Surgical placement): $3,978 - $9,999
  - Procedure 1650 (Rebase hybrid): $596 - $4,000

## Billing System Impact Analysis

### 1. Procedure Entry Issues
- **Future-Dated Entries**: 28 procedures dated between 2024-2025
  - Procedure 723: Multiple instances at $25,500 (schedule: $9,000)
  - Procedure 724: Range $10,324 - $25,500 (schedule: $9,000)
  - Procedure 266: Fixed at $9,999
  - Procedure 6: Consistent at $113 (matches schedule)
- **None assigned to statements** (all have `statement_id = 0`)

### 2. Fee Schedule vs Actual Charges

| Procedure Code | Description | Actual Charge | Schedule Amount | Markup % | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|--------|
| D6114 (723) | Implant/abutment fixed denture - maxillary | $25,500.00 | $9,000.00 | 183% | Prosthetic, full arch |
| D6115 (724) | Implant/abutment fixed denture - mandibular | $25,500.00 | $9,000.00 | 183% | Prosthetic, full arch |
| D5865 (705) | Overdenture - complete mandibular | $25,500.00 | $934.30 | 2,629% | Non-prosthetic, standard denture |

**Additional Procedure Analysis:**
1. **D6114/D6115 (Implant Supported Dentures)**
   - Prosthetic procedures (high-value expected)
   - Consistent fee schedule amount ($9,000) across schedules
   - Full arch procedures (maxillary/mandibular)
   - Markup still excessive but more understandable given procedure type

2. **D5865 (Complete Overdenture)**
   - Non-prosthetic procedure
   - Wide fee variation ($934.30 - $2,400)
   - Standard denture procedure
   - 2,629% markup appears completely unjustified
   - Present in 3 fee schedules with significant variation

3. **Common Characteristics**
   - All are treatment area 6 (full arch procedures)
   - All marked as single-visit procedures
   - All use '/X/' procedure time indicator

**Risk Assessment Update:**
- D5865 overcharges represent highest risk
- D6114/D6115 charges need review but are less severe given procedure type
- Fee schedule standardization needed across all three procedures

### 3. Unbilled Procedures Analysis
- Total identified high-value procedures: 28
- Combined unbilled amount: >$500,000
- Opportunity to correct before billing cycle

## Recommendations

### Data Validation Rules
1. Implement maximum fee thresholds:
   - Global cap at $10,000 unless specifically justified
   - Procedure-specific caps based on historical data
2. Add validation for fee variations:
   - Flag fees exceeding 10x the median for same procedure
   - Require justification for fees varying >500% from median

### Process Improvements
1. Implement decimal point validation:
   - Compare new fees against procedure medians
   - Warning for fees 100x higher than typical values
2. Zero fee policy:
   - Require explicit justification for $0 fees
   - Flag procedures with mixed zero/non-zero fees

### Immediate Action Items
1. System Validations
   - Implement date validation to prevent future dating
   - Add fee variance alerts for >50% schedule deviation
   - Require management approval for fees >$10,000

2. Data Cleanup
   - Remove or correct all procedures dated 2024-2025
   - Review and adjust all procedures with >100% markup
   - Audit all procedures with fees >$10,000

3. Process Changes
   - Implement dual verification for high-value procedures
   - Add automated fee schedule comparison checks
   - Create exception report for fee schedule deviations
