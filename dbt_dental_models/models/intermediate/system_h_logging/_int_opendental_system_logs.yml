    description: >
      Intermediate model for system entry logs. Contains audit trail information about 
      user actions and system events, tracking who performed what action and when.
      
      Log Source Values:
      - 0: Main system log (98.15% of records)
      - 7: Specific module (1.48% of records)
      - 16: Rare events (0.02% of records)
      - 19: Another specific module (0.35% of records)
      
      Note: All records have foreign_key_type = 0, indicating they are system entries.
      The differentiation between different types of entries is handled by log_source.
      
      Key features:
      - Tracks all system activities with detailed user attribution
      - Maintains one-to-one relationship with entry logs
      - Records user actions and system events
      - Provides comprehensive audit trail for compliance
      - Integrates with user management system
      - Records user group membership for access control
      - Tracks system-generated vs user-initiated actions
      
      Data Sources:
      - stg_opendental__entrylog: Base system logging data
      - stg_opendental__userod: User information and permissions
      - stg_opendental__usergroup: User group definitions
      
      Business rules:
      - One record per system activity (entry_log_id)
      - System-generated entries (user_id = 0) have null user_name
      - All timestamps must be after 2020-01-01
      - User group information required for non-system entries
      - Entry timestamps must not be in the future
      - Foreign key references must be valid for their respective types
      
      Key metrics:
      - System activity volume by type
      - User action frequency
      - System-generated vs user-initiated actions
      - Activity patterns by user group
      - Activity timing patterns
      
      Grain: One record per system activity (entry_log_id)
      
      Primary key: entry_log_id
      
      Foreign keys:
      - user_id -> stg_opendental__userod.user_id
      - user_group_id -> stg_opendental__usergroup.usergroup_id
      - foreign_key -> Various tables based on log_source
      
      Dependencies:
      - stg_opendental__entrylog
      - stg_opendental__userod
      - stg_opendental__usergroup
      
      Data quality requirements:
      - All required fields must be non-null
      - Timestamps must be valid and not in the future
      - User references must be valid
      - Foreign key references must be valid
      - System entries must be properly identified
      - User group assignments must be valid
