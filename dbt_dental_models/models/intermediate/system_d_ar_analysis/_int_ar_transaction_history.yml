    description: >
      Chronological transaction history model that provides a detailed timeline
      of all AR-related activities. This model builds on shared calculations
      to create a comprehensive transaction record with proper categorization
      and balance impact tracking.
      
      Key features:
      - Creates a chronological sequence of all AR transactions
      - Categorizes transactions by type (procedure, payment, adjustment)
      - Tracks balance impact (increase/decrease)
      - Identifies insurance vs patient transactions
      - Maintains detailed payment and adjustment information
      - Supports incremental loading with 7-day lookback
      - Excludes zero-amount transactions
      
      Data Sources:
      - int_ar_shared_calculations: Base transaction data with aging and categorization
      
      Business rules:
      - Transactions are ordered chronologically by date, patient, and procedure
      - Each transaction has a unique identifier
      - Balance impact is determined by transaction amount
      - Transaction type is determined by payment/adjustment presence
      - Insurance transactions are clearly identified
      - Zero-amount transactions are excluded
      - Incremental loading uses 7-day lookback window
