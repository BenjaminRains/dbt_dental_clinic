    description: >
      Comprehensive procedure model that consolidates clinical procedure data with complete fee information and validation.
      
      This model provides clinical procedure tracking and supports fee processing workflows.
      Part of System A: Fee Processing & Verification workflow.
      
      Key Features:
      - Fee Validation: Compares actual procedure fees against standard fee schedules with tolerance checking
      - Clinical Integration: Enriches procedures with notes, provider information, and treatment classifications
      - Fee Statistics: Aggregates min, max, and average fees by procedure code for pricing analysis
      - Status Tracking: Resolves coded values to human-readable descriptions using definition lookups
      - Data Quality: Comprehensive validation flags and business rule enforcement
      
      Data Sources:
      - stg_opendental__procedurelog: Base procedure records, statuses, fees, and patient assignments
      - stg_opendental__procedurecode: ADA procedure code definitions, descriptions, and clinical flags
      - stg_opendental__fee: Standard fee amounts, schedules, and clinic-specific pricing
      - stg_opendental__feesched: Fee schedule definitions, types, and visibility settings
      - stg_opendental__definition: Status descriptions, treatment areas, and fee type lookups
      - stg_opendental__procnote: Clinical notes, timestamps, and documentation history
      
      Clinical Logic Features:
      - Procedure Classification: Categorizes procedures by hygiene, prosthetic, and multi-visit flags
      - Treatment Area Mapping: Links procedures to anatomical treatment areas with descriptions
      - Provider Workflow: Associates procedures with performing providers and clinic locations
      - Note Aggregation: Consolidates all clinical notes with count and timestamp tracking
      
      Fee Processing Features:
      - Standard Fee Lookup: Retrieves most recent fee schedule entries by procedure code and clinic
      - Fee Variance Analysis: Calculates differences between charged and standard fees
      - Out-of-Network Logic: Accounts for clinic's 99.99% use of default fee schedule (ID 0)
      - Fee Statistics: Provides comprehensive fee analytics per procedure code
      
      Data Quality Notes:
      - procedure_id = 0 records excluded: These represent financial transactions rather than clinical procedures
      - Fee Validation Tolerance: Uses 0.01 precision tolerance for decimal comparison accuracy
      - Historical Data Handling: Includes procedures from November 2022 onwards with legacy data exceptions
      - Known Fee Anomaly: D0180 in schedule 8290 shows $11,611.0 vs normal $116.11 (data entry error)
      - Definition Dependencies: Category IDs assumed based on OpenDental standards (4=status, 5=treatment_area, 6=fee_type)
      
      Clinical Rules:
      - Completed Procedures: Must have non-zero fees and valid procedure codes
      - Fee Matching: Standard fee lookups prioritize most recent clinic-specific entries
      - Note Requirements: Completed procedures should have associated clinical documentation
