/*
    Intermediate model for claim_details
    Part of System B: Insurance & Claims Processing
    
    This model:
    1. Combines claim data with detailed procedure and insurance information
    2. Provides comprehensive view of claim procedures with financial details
    3. Integrates insurance coverage verification and benefit information
    4. Includes claim form template details for form management and analytics
    
    Business Logic Features:
    - Claim Procedure Integration: Links claims to specific procedures with billing details
    - Insurance Coverage Mapping: Associates claims with active insurance plans and benefits
    - Financial Tracking: Tracks billed, allowed, paid amounts and patient responsibility
    - Procedure Classification: Includes procedure codes, categories, and treatment area details
    - Form Template Integration: Associates claims with their form templates and layout settings
    
    Data Quality Notes:
    - Some claims may have multiple procedures requiring composite key handling
    - Insurance coverage data depends on verification status and effective dates
    - Financial amounts may be null for pending or rejected claims
    - Claim form templates may be null for claims without specified forms
    
    Performance Considerations:
    - Uses table materialization due to complex joins across multiple large tables
    - Indexed on key lookup fields (claim_id, patient_id, procedure_id)
    - Consider incremental materialization if volume becomes problematic
