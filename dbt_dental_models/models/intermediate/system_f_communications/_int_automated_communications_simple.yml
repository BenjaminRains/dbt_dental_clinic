    description: >
      Comprehensive automated communications model that tracks system-generated messages
      sent to patients. This model consolidates all automated, template-based communications
      into a structured format that enables tracking of delivery, engagement, and effectiveness.

      Grain: One row per automated communication sent to a patient. Each record represents 
      a single message sent through an automated system with automated_communication_id 
      as the primary key.

      Key features:
      - Identifies communications sent through automated systems
      - Links to base communication records and templates
      - Tracks triggers that initiated the communication
      - Monitors delivery status and timestamps
      - Provides metrics on engagement (opens, clicks, replies)
      - Enables analysis of automated communication effectiveness
      - Supports campaign performance tracking
      - Uses advanced template matching with trigram similarity
      - Implements fallback matching for non-PostgreSQL databases
      - Filters matches to active templates only

      Special Note on provider_id = 0:
      This is a special case used for communications that aren't directly from a specific provider.
      Analysis shows these communications fall into several categories:
      1. Truly automated system communications:
         - Balance notices (811 records)
         - Appointment reminders (46 records)
         - Review requests (32 records)
         - Post-op instructions (24 records)
      2. Staff-initiated communications through system interfaces:
         - Notes with staff initials (e.g., "-MW", "-KB")
         - Communication department activities (marked with "CD")
      3. Automated business communications:
         - End of year letters
         - Statements with final notices
         - Insurance-related communications
      
      Distribution of provider_id = 0 communications by type:
      - Type 228 (Secondary automated system): 2,462 records
      - Type 226 (Billing communications): 998 records
      - Type 603 (Tertiary system): 485 records
      - Type 225 (Insurance communications): 436 records
      - Type 571 (Insurance narratives): 227 records

      This special case should be considered when analyzing provider-specific communications
      or when building reports that need to distinguish between provider and non-provider
      communications.

      Data Sources:
      - int_patient_communications_base: Base communication data
      - int_automated_communication_flags: Automation detection and metrics
      - int_communication_templates: Template definitions with trigram indexing

      Template Matching Strategy:
      - Primary matching uses PostgreSQL's trigram similarity (threshold 0.4)
      - Fallback to LIKE matching for non-PostgreSQL databases
      - Only matches against active templates
      - Additional matching based on category and communication mode
      - Optimized with GIN index on template content

      REFACTORED TO BREAK CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY:
      - Uses int_patient_communications_base for base data
      - Uses int_automated_communication_flags for automation detection
      - Joins with int_communication_templates for template info
