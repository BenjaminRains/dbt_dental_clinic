    description: >
      Model that adds automation detection flags to base communications.
      This model identifies likely automated messages using patterns and provides
      engagement metrics for automated communications.

      Grain: One row per automated communication, identified by communication_id.
      Each record represents a single automated message with its associated flags
      and metrics.

      Key features:
      - Identifies automated communications using pattern matching
      - Determines trigger types and details
      - Tracks engagement metrics (opens, clicks, replies)
      - Monitors delivery status
      - Supports analysis of automated communication effectiveness
      - Pre-aggregates batch communications for performance
      - Optimizes pattern matching with pre-filtered content
      - Includes safety checks for batch detection and self-matching

      Data Sources:
      - int_patient_communications_base: Base communication data
      - Pattern matching for automation detection
      - Content analysis for trigger identification
      - stg_opendental__commlog: For reply tracking
