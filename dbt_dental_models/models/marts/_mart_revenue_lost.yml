    description: >
      Summary mart for comprehensive revenue lost analysis and opportunity tracking.
      This mart provides detailed analysis of all forms of revenue leakage and missed opportunities,
      enabling proactive revenue recovery and operational optimization across multiple opportunity types.
      
      ## Business Context
      The revenue lost summary mart is a critical component of our analytical framework, enabling:
      - Revenue leakage identification and quantification across all business processes
      - Recovery opportunity prioritization and action planning
      - Operational efficiency analysis and improvement tracking
      - Financial impact assessment and forecasting
      - Performance monitoring and alerting for revenue protection
      - Executive reporting and revenue optimization dashboards
      
      ## Technical Specifications
      - Grain: One row per date + opportunity_id combination (unique opportunity instance)
      - Source: fact_appointment, fact_claim, stg_opendental__treatplan, stg_opendental__adjustment (primary sources)
      - Refresh: Daily
      - Dependencies: 
        * fact_appointment (missed appointments and cancellations)
        * fact_claim (claim rejections and denials)
        * stg_opendental__treatplan (treatment plan delays)
        * stg_opendental__adjustment (write-offs and adjustments)
        * dim_provider (provider information and relationships)
        * dim_patient (patient information and demographics)
        * dim_date (date dimension for temporal analysis)
      
      ## Business Logic
      ### Opportunity Identification
      - Missed Appointments: No-shows and cancellations with scheduled production amounts
      - Claim Rejections: Insurance denials, claim rejections, and processing issues
      - Treatment Plan Delays: Delayed treatment plan starts (90+ days old)
      - Write Offs: Credit adjustments and charge adjustments from adjustment table
      
      ### Recovery Potential Scoring
      - High: No-shows, recent claim rejections with patient responsibility
      - Medium: Cancellations with <24 hour notice, delayed treatment plans (90-180 days)
      - Low: Cancellations with >24 hour notice, very delayed treatment plans (180+ days), charge adjustments
      - None: Zero adjustments and other non-recoverable items
      
      ### Priority Scoring Algorithm (0-100)
      - Revenue Impact (0-40 points): Based on lost revenue amount thresholds
      - Recovery Potential (0-30 points): High=30, Medium=20, Low=10, None=0
      - Opportunity Type (0-20 points): Missed Appointment=20, Claim Rejection=15, Treatment Plan Delay=10, Write Off=5
      - Recency (0-10 points): Recent (30 days)=10, Moderate (90 days)=5, Old=0
      
      ### Financial Impact Categorization
      - No Revenue Impact: $0 lost revenue
      - Low Impact: <$100 lost revenue
      - Medium Impact: $100-500 lost revenue
      - High Impact: $500-1000 lost revenue
      - Very High Impact: >$1000 lost revenue
      
      ### Time Impact Analysis
      - No Time Impact: No lost time minutes
      - Low Time Impact: <30 minutes
      - Medium Time Impact: 30-60 minutes
      - High Time Impact: 60-120 minutes
      - Very High Time Impact: >120 minutes
      
      ## Data Quality Notes
      - Treatment plan data may have incomplete status information (all currently show as Active)
      - Claim rejection data depends on insurance processing accuracy and timing
      - Some opportunity types may have null provider_id (treatment plans, claim rejections)
      - UnfilledSlots analysis removed due to missing schedule table columns
      - Estimated recoverable amounts use conservative recovery rates (High=80%, Medium=50%, Low=20%)
      
      ## Performance Considerations
      - Large volume model due to comprehensive opportunity tracking across all business processes
      - Indexed on key analytical dimensions (date_id, provider_id, patient_id, opportunity_type, recovery_potential)
      - Uses efficient window functions for opportunity scoring and prioritization
      - Date filtering applied to limit historical data volume (1-2 years depending on opportunity type)
      - Complex business logic calculations may impact query performance on large datasets
      
      ## Usage Notes
      - Use for revenue recovery prioritization and action planning workflows
      - Recovery priority scores range from 0-100 (higher = more urgent)
      - Recovery timeline provides realistic expectations for opportunity resolution
      - Preventability assessment helps identify process improvement opportunities
      - Boolean flags provide quick filtering for common revenue recovery scenarios
      - Estimated recoverable amounts help with financial planning and goal setting
      
      ## Business Impact
      - Critical for revenue protection and cash flow optimization
      - Enables proactive revenue recovery efforts and reduces revenue leakage
      - Supports operational efficiency improvements and process optimization
      - Drives data-driven decision making for revenue management
      - Provides transparency into revenue loss patterns and trends
