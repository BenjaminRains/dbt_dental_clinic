    description: >
      Summary mart for comprehensive appointment analytics and scheduling efficiency.
      This mart provides aggregated metrics and KPIs to support scheduling optimization,
      patient flow analysis, and operational performance tracking at the daily level
      by provider and clinic.
      
      ## Business Context
      The appointment summary mart is a critical component of our analytical framework, enabling:
      - Scheduling optimization and capacity planning
      - Provider performance analysis and benchmarking
      - Patient experience and wait time analysis
      - Financial performance tracking and production efficiency
      - Operational decision making and resource allocation
      - Executive reporting and operational dashboards
      
      ## Technical Specifications
      - Grain: One row per date + provider + clinic combination
      - Source: fact_appointment (primary source)
      - Refresh: Daily
      - Dependencies: 
        * fact_appointment (core appointment transaction data)
        * dim_provider (provider dimension lookups)
        * dim_date (date dimension for temporal analysis)
      
      ## Business Logic
      ### Aggregation Rules
      - Daily aggregation by appointment_date, provider_id, and clinic_id
      - Time-based metrics aggregated using COALESCE to handle NULL values from data quality fixes
      - Financial metrics calculated from scheduled and completed production amounts
      - Utilization rates calculated using safe division with nullif() to prevent division by zero
      
      ### Metric Calculations
      - Completion rates: completed_appointments / total_appointments * 100
      - No-show rates: no_show_appointments / total_appointments * 100
      - Time utilization: productive_minutes / total_scheduled_minutes * 100
      - Production efficiency: completed_production / total_scheduled_production * 100
      
      ### Performance Categorization
      - Completion Performance: Excellent (≥95%), Good (≥90%), Fair (≥85%), Poor (<85%)
      - Reliability Performance: Excellent (≤5% no-show), Good (≤10%), Fair (≤15%), Poor (>15%)
      - Utilization Performance: Excellent (≥85%), Good (≥75%), Fair (≥65%), Poor (<65%)
      - Schedule Intensity: Standard Day (≤8hrs), Extended Day (≤10hrs), Long Day (>10hrs)
      
      ## Data Quality Notes
      - Handles null appointment dates by filtering them out in the base CTE
      - Uses safe division with nullif() for percentage calculations to prevent division by zero
      - Time calculations from fact_appointment include data quality validation
      - Negative time values are handled by converting to NULL in source fact table
      - Uses COALESCE to handle NULL time values in aggregations for patient experience metrics
      
      ## Performance Considerations
      - Aggregated at date/provider/clinic grain for optimal query performance
      - Uses efficient joins with dimension tables
      - Indexed on primary query dimensions (date_id, provider_id, clinic_id)
      - Materialized as table for fast analytical queries
      
      ## Usage Notes
      - Primary use case: Daily operational reporting and performance monitoring
      - Best for: Provider performance analysis, scheduling efficiency, capacity planning
      - Limitations: Not suitable for individual appointment analysis (use fact_appointment)
      - Common analysis: Trend analysis over time, provider comparisons, clinic performance
      - Best practices: Filter by date ranges for large datasets, use performance categories for benchmarking

          - System sets dismissed_datetime < appointment_datetime, causing calculation to return NULL
          - Affects scheduled appointments where dismissal time is not properly recorded

          Calculation Logic:
