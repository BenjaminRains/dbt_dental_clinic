Patient Retention Mart - Comprehensive patient lifecycle and retention analysis
Part of System G: Scheduling and Patient Management

This model:
1. Provides comprehensive patient retention tracking and lifecycle analysis
2. Calculates churn risk assessment and patient lifetime value metrics
3. Enables retention optimization insights and engagement pattern analysis

Business Logic Features:
- Patient lifecycle stage classification (Active, Recent, Moderate, Dormant, Inactive, Lost)
- Churn risk scoring with multi-factor assessment (0-100 scale)
- Patient value categorization based on lifetime production
- Engagement level assessment combining visit frequency and communication responsiveness
- Loyalty segmentation based on tenure, visit patterns, and provider diversity

Key Metrics:
- Retention Status: Current patient engagement level classification
- Churn Risk Score: 0-100 risk assessment for patient loss
- Patient Lifetime Value: Annual production value and visit-based metrics
- Engagement Metrics: Communication response rates and visit frequency patterns
- Loyalty Indicators: Patient tenure and provider relationship diversity

Data Quality Notes:
- Excludes patients without first visit dates to ensure data completeness
- Handles null values in financial calculations with proper coalesce logic
- Uses safe division with nullif to prevent division by zero errors
- Filters to active patient statuses only (Patient, Inactive)
- Handles future appointment dates by excluding them from time-based calculations
- Patients with future appointments are classified as 'Scheduled' retention status
- Negative time calculations are prevented by filtering out future dates

Performance Considerations:
- Indexed on key query dimensions (date_id, patient_id, provider_id, clinic_id)
- Optimized joins using proper foreign key relationships
- Efficient aggregations with conditional counting and summing
- Window functions for complex patient lifecycle calculations

Dependencies:
- dim_patient: Patient demographic and status information
- dim_provider: Provider details and specialty information
- dim_date: Date dimension for temporal analysis
- fact_appointment: Appointment history and completion data
- fact_payment: Financial transaction and payment history
- fact_claim: Production and billing information
- fact_communication: Patient communication and engagement data
