      Summary mart for comprehensive provider performance analytics and tracking.
      This mart provides aggregated metrics and KPIs to support provider performance
      management and operational optimization, enabling stakeholders to analyze trends,
      performance, and business outcomes at the provider level across all clinics.
      
      ## Business Context
      The provider performance summary mart is a critical component of our analytical framework, enabling:
      - Provider productivity analysis and performance benchmarking
      - Practice management and provider development decisions
      - Comparative performance analysis across providers and specialties
      - Operational optimization through key performance indicator tracking
      - Executive reporting and provider performance dashboards
      - Scheduling efficiency and appointment management optimization
      
      ## Technical Specifications
      - Grain: One row per date + provider (one row per date_id + provider_id combination)
      - Source: mart_production_summary, mart_appointment_summary, dim_date, dim_provider (primary sources)
      - Refresh: Daily
      - Dependencies: 
        * mart_production_summary (core production and scheduling data)
        * mart_appointment_summary (appointment efficiency and timing metrics)
        * dim_date (date dimension for temporal analysis)
        * dim_provider (provider master data and attributes)
        * dim_procedure (procedure classification and complexity flags)
        * dim_patient (patient demographic and complexity indicators)
      
      ## Business Logic
      ### Production Aggregation
      - Aggregates production and collection metrics across all clinics for each provider
      - Calculates production per hour using productive hours as denominator
      - Computes collection efficiency as percentage of collections to production
      - Handles division by zero using nullif() functions for data quality
      
      ### Performance Categorization
      - Collection Performance: Excellent (≥98%), Good (≥95%), Fair (≥90%), Poor (<90%)
      - Scheduling Performance: Excellent (≥95%), Good (≥90%), Fair (≥85%), Poor (<85%)
      - Reliability Performance: Excellent (≤5% no-show), Good (≤10%), Fair (≤15%), Poor (>15%)
      - Utilization Category: Full (≥7hrs), Good (≥5hrs), Moderate (≥3hrs), Low (<3hrs)
      
      ### Ranking and Benchmarking
      - Production ranking within specialty and overall practice
      - Monthly trend analysis with daily production vs monthly comparison
      - Performance benchmarking against specialty and practice averages
      
      ## Data Quality Notes
      - Handles null values in division operations with nullif() functions
      - Aggregates data across multiple clinics for provider-level analysis
      - Uses window functions for comparative rankings with proper partitioning
      - Preserves data lineage from upstream mart models
      - Patient demographic metrics set to 0 (calculated separately if needed)
      - Claims metrics set to 0 (would need separate aggregation from fact_claim)
      
      ## Performance Considerations
      - Optimized with composite indexes on date_id and provider_id
      - Uses efficient joins with proper foreign key relationships
      - Implements window functions for ranking calculations with partitioning
      - Aggregates complex metrics in separate CTEs for clarity and performance
      - Monthly trend calculations use date_trunc for efficient grouping
      
      ## Usage Notes
      - Primary use case: Provider performance monitoring and benchmarking
      - Supports provider development and practice management decisions
      - Enables comparative analysis across specialties and time periods
      - Monthly context provides trend analysis capabilities
      - Performance categories enable quick identification of outliers
      - Rankings support competitive analysis within practice
      
      ## Known Issues
      - Patient demographic metrics (age, diseases, premedication) are placeholder values
      - Claims processing metrics are placeholder values requiring separate fact_claim aggregation
      - Procedure type breakdowns (hygiene, radiology, prosthetic) are placeholder values
      - New patient count aggregation may not match individual appointment records
