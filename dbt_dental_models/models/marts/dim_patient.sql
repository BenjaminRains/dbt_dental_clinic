/*
    Dimension model for Patient
    Part of System A: Core Data Foundation
    
    This model:
    1. Provides comprehensive patient demographic and clinical information
    2. Supports patient relationship management and family linkages
    3. Enables financial analysis and balance tracking
    4. Facilitates clinical workflow and care coordination
    
    Business Logic Features:
    - Demographics: age, gender, language, contact preferences
    - Clinical: disease tracking, document management, provider relationships
    - Financial: balance aging, insurance status, payment preferences
    - Relationships: family links, guarantor relationships, provider assignments
    
    Key Metrics:
    - Patient demographics and segmentation
    - Financial balance and aging analysis
    - Clinical risk indicators and disease management
    - Provider assignment and care coordination
    
    Data Quality Notes:
    - Patient status codes mapped to business-friendly descriptions
    - Age calculated from birth_date for consistency
    - Balance fields aggregated from financial transactions
    - Disease and document counts from related tables
    
    Performance Considerations:
    - Indexed on patient_id for optimal join performance
    - Provider and clinic indexes for common filtering patterns
    - Status and date indexes for analytical queries
    
    Dependencies:
    - int_patient_profile: Intermediate model with patient demographics, notes, and family links
    - stg_opendental__disease: Active disease conditions (TODO: move to intermediate)
    - stg_opendental__document: Patient document management (TODO: move to intermediate)
