    description: >
      Summary mart for comprehensive production analytics and performance tracking.
      This mart provides aggregated metrics and KPIs to support financial performance
      monitoring, operational reporting, and provider performance analysis at daily
      granularity by provider and clinic.
      
      ## Business Context
      The production summary mart is a critical component of our analytical framework, enabling:
      - Daily production performance monitoring and alerting
      - Provider efficiency analysis and benchmarking
      - Financial performance tracking and goal achievement
      - Operational decision making and resource optimization
      - Executive reporting and dashboard analytics
      - Collection rate analysis and payment timing insights
      
      ## Technical Specifications
      - Grain: One row per date + provider + clinic combination
      - Source: fact_appointment, fact_claim, fact_payment (primary sources)
      - Refresh: Daily
      - Dependencies: 
        * fact_appointment (core scheduling and appointment data)
        * fact_claim (billing and production amounts)
        * fact_payment (payment and collection data)
        * dim_date (date dimension for temporal analysis)
        * dim_provider (provider information and categorization)
        * dim_procedure (procedure categorization and analysis)
        * stg_opendental__procedurelog (procedure details and fees)
        * stg_opendental__payment (payment transactions)
        * stg_opendental__paysplit (payment provider associations)
        * int_adjustments (adjustment transactions)
      
      ## Business Logic
      ### Production Aggregation Rules
      - Scheduled vs Actual Production: Compares scheduled production amounts with actual procedure fees
      - Completion Rate Calculation: Completed appointments divided by total appointments
      - Collection Rate Analysis: Collected amounts divided by actual production
      - Time Utilization: Productive minutes divided by scheduled minutes
      
      ### Performance Categorization
      - Appointment Performance: Excellent (≥95%), Good (≥90%), Fair (≥80%), Poor (<80%)
      - Collection Performance: Excellent (≥98%), Good (≥95%), Fair (≥90%), Poor (<90%)
      - Provider Performance Tiers: Based on multiple KPIs including completion and collection rates
      
      ### Payment Processing
      - Patient Payments: Payment type 69 (patient payments)
      - Insurance Payments: Payment type 71 (insurance payments)
      - Adjustments: Handled separately through int_adjustments model
      - Provider Association: Through procedurelog or paysplit relationships
      
      ## Data Quality Notes
      - Appointment-claim relationships may have data quality issues (assumed join logic)
      - Production amounts may include estimates vs actuals requiring validation
      - Payment timing may not align perfectly with appointment dates
      - Clinic_id may be NULL in some payment records (defaulted to 0)
      - Provider associations through paysplit may not capture all payment relationships
      
      ## Performance Considerations
      - Large aggregation across multiple fact tables requires proper indexing
      - Date-based partitioning recommended for historical analysis
      - Provider and clinic dimensions should be pre-joined for efficiency
      - Complex payment aggregation logic may impact refresh performance
      - Consider materialized view for frequently accessed metrics
      
      ## Usage Notes
      - Use for daily production monitoring and trend analysis
      - Provider performance comparisons should account for specialty differences
      - Collection rates may be delayed due to payment processing timing
      - Appointment completion rates are key operational indicators
      - Time utilization metrics help optimize scheduling efficiency
      - Payment metrics provide insights into cash flow and collection patterns
