    description: >
      Fact table for appointment scheduling and tracking analytics. This model serves as the foundation for 
      appointment-level analysis and reporting, providing comprehensive information about each appointment 
      including scheduling details, timing metrics, status tracking, and operational outcomes.
      
      This fact table serves as the central hub for appointment analytics and provides critical insights 
      into practice scheduling efficiency, patient flow, and operational performance.
      Part of System G: Scheduling and Appointment Management workflow.
      
      Key Features:
      - Complete appointment lifecycle tracking from scheduling to completion
      - Provider and patient relationship management with timing metrics
      - Scheduling efficiency metrics including wait times and treatment duration
      - Appointment outcome categorization (completed, no-show, cancelled, etc.)
      - Financial goal tracking and production planning support
      
      Data Sources:
      - stg_opendental__appointment: Primary source data for appointment details, timing, and status information
      
      Business Logic Features:
      - Appointment status categorization with business rule logic for operational outcomes
        * All appointment_status values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] are now explicitly mapped
        * Status 2 and 8 both map to 'Completed' (Complete and PtNoteCompleted)
        * Status 1 and 6 both map to 'Scheduled' (Scheduled and Planned)
      - Timing calculations with data quality validation to handle illogical time sequences
      - Appointment duration categorization (Short, Standard, Long, Extended) based on business thresholds
      - No-show detection logic based on arrival status and appointment date comparison
      - Future appointment identification for scheduling analytics
      
      Financial Calculations:
      - Production goal tracking (currently set to zero as not available at appointment level)
      - Scheduled production amount calculations (currently set to zero as not available at appointment level)
      - Procedure count and code tracking (currently null as not available at appointment level)
      
      Data Quality Notes:
      - Appointment confirmation functionality is not currently used by the clinic (confirmation fields set to defaults)
      - Procedure details are not available at appointment level (set to null/zero values)
      - Some appointment types may have legacy or non-standard status codes
      - Time calculations include data quality validation to handle illogical time sequences
      - Negative time values are converted to NULL to prevent calculation errors in downstream models
      - Appointment duration calculations require dismissed_datetime >= appointment_datetime for validity
      
      Business Rules:
      - Appointment status transitions must follow valid business workflow states
      - Timing calculations must maintain logical sequence (arrival <= seated <= dismissed)
      - No-show determination requires both null arrival and past appointment date
      - Appointment duration categories follow business-defined thresholds (30, 60, 120 minutes)

          Business-determined outcome status for appointment analytics
          
          Valid Values:
          - 'Completed': Appointment was successfully completed
          - 'Cancelled': Appointment was cancelled or broken
          - 'ASAP': Urgent appointment requiring immediate attention
          - 'No Show': Patient did not arrive for scheduled appointment
          - 'Scheduled': Appointment is scheduled but not yet completed
          - 'Unscheduled': Appointment is on unscheduled list (status 3)
          - 'PtNote': Patient note appointment (status 7)
          
          Calculation Logic (Priority Order):
          - Priority 1: appointment_status = 2 OR appointment_status = 8 → 'Completed'
            * Status 2 = Complete (standard completed appointment)
            * Status 8 = PtNoteCompleted (patient note appointment completed)
          - Priority 2: is_complete flag = TRUE → 'Completed' (fallback, should align with status 2)
          - Priority 3: appointment_status = 5 → 'Cancelled' (Broken/Missed)
          - Priority 4: appointment_status = 4 → 'ASAP' (urgent appointment)
          - Priority 5: appointment_status = 3 → 'Unscheduled' (UnschedList)
          - Priority 6: appointment_status = 7 → 'PtNote' (patient note appointment)
          - Priority 7: appointment_status = 6 → 'Scheduled' (Planned)
          - Priority 8: appointment_status = 1 → 'Scheduled' (Scheduled)
          - Priority 9: Past appointment without check-in → 'No Show'
          - Fallback: Any unmapped status → 'Scheduled'
          
          Business Rules:
          - 'Completed' includes both status 2 (Complete) and status 8 (PtNoteCompleted)
          - 'No Show' determined by null check_in_time and past appointment date without completion
          - 'Cancelled' maps to status 5 (Broken/Missed)
          - 'ASAP' maps to status 4 (urgent scheduling requirement)
          - 'Unscheduled' maps to status 3 (UnschedList - requires investigation in source)
          - 'PtNote' maps to status 7 (patient note appointment - distinct from regular appointments)
          - 'Scheduled' includes both status 1 (Scheduled) and status 6 (Planned)
          
          Data Quality Notes:
          - Previously missing explicit mappings for status values 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8
          - Logic now handles all documented appointment_status values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
          - Status 3 (UnschedList) should be investigated in source system if appearing frequently
          - Status 7 and 8 (PtNote variants) are valid but may be rare in some practices
          
          Operational Impact:
          - Drives appointment outcome analytics and reporting
          - Affects no-show tracking and patient communication strategies
          - Critical for operational performance measurement

          Business categorization of appointment duration for analytics
          
          Valid Values:

          - 'Extended': More than 120 minutes
          - 'Unknown': Duration could not be calculated
          
          Business Rules:
          - Categories based on appointment_length_minutes calculation
          - 'Short' appointments typically include quick procedures or consultations
          - 'Standard' appointments are typical routine procedures
