    description: >
      Staging model for insurance bluebook log entries that track historical changes to allowed fees 
      for claim procedures. This table serves as an audit trail for fee adjustments and contains two 
      primary types of records: UCR (Usual, Customary, Reasonable) fee calculations that don't link 
      to specific claim procedures, and allowed fee records from actual received insurance claims.
      
      Each log entry represents a point-in-time calculation or adjustment of what an insurance 
      carrier allows for a specific procedure. The model includes comprehensive historical data 
      dating back to 2021, enabling analysis of fee trends, insurance payment patterns, and 
      claim processing outcomes over time.

      usage_notes: >
        This model is essential for insurance analysis, fee schedule management, and claim payment reconciliation.
        When analyzing actual insurance payments, filter out UCR Fee records by checking the description field
        for 'Rule Type: UCR Fee'. The allowed_fee field represents the insurance carrier's determination of
        the allowable amount for a procedure, which may differ from both the procedure fee and the actual
        payment amount. Use this data in conjunction with claim payment data to understand complete payment flows.
        Historical relationships to procedures are maintained even for deleted procedures to preserve audit integrity.

          Primary key for insurance bluebook log entries. Maps to InsBlueBookLogNum in OpenDental.
          Unique identifier for each fee calculation or adjustment event in the insurance processing system.
          This ID provides traceability for all allowed fee determinations and changes over time.

          Foreign key to claim procedures table. Links this log entry to a specific claim procedure
          when the log represents an actual insurance claim processing event. Note that UCR Fee
          records may reference claim procedure IDs that don't correspond to actual submitted claims
          but rather theoretical fee schedule calculations. May be null for system-generated entries.

      # Business Data Fields
      - name: allowed_fee
        description: >
          The allowed fee amount determined by the insurance carrier for this procedure.
          Represents the maximum amount the insurance considers reasonable for the procedure
          based on their fee schedule, UCR calculations, or contract terms. May be 0.00 when
          the procedure's actual fee is less than the calculated UCR amount. Critical for
          payment reconciliation and fee schedule analysis.

          Detailed text description of the fee calculation or adjustment event. Contains critical
          information about the rule type (UCR Fee, contract rate, etc.), calculation method,
          and reason for the allowed amount. Common patterns include 'Rule Type: UCR Fee' for
          theoretical calculations and specific adjustment reasons for claim-based entries.
          Essential for understanding the business logic behind each fee determination.

      # Date Fields

          Represents when the fee calculation or adjustment was performed, not necessarily when
          the associated procedure was completed. Used for temporal analysis of fee changes and
          insurance processing patterns.
