      usage_notes: >
        - Use this model for payroll processing, time tracking, and workforce management
        - Regular hours, overtime, and PTO hours are tracked separately
        - Automatic entries are flagged with is_auto
        - Unpaid protected leave is tracked separately with is_unpaid_protected_leave
        - All time entries require an employee and clinic association

      - name: clinic_id
        description: >
          Foreign key to the clinic where the time adjustment was recorded (maps to ClinicNum in OpenDental).
          A value of 0 represents the main/default clinic location. This is common in single-clinic
          practices and for system-generated entries. Field maintained for OpenDental compatibility.

      - name: pto_def_id
        description: >
          Foreign key to the PTO definition if this adjustment is for paid time off (maps to PtoDefNum in OpenDental).
          A value of 0 indicates no PTO definition is associated with this time adjustment.
          NULL values are valid and indicate pending time adjustment requests that haven't been processed yet.
          Note: Currently not linked to any definition table as PTO definitions are not tracked in the system.
          The field exists in the source data but is not actively used for PTO categorization.

      - name: secu_user_entry_id
        description: >
          Foreign key to the user who entered the time adjustment (maps to SecuUserNumEntry in OpenDental).
          A value of 0 indicates a system-generated entry, particularly when is_auto = true.
          For manual entries (is_auto = false), this field may also be 0 for historical records
          or when the user information was not captured.
