    description: >
      Staging model for user group attachments in OpenDental. Contains information about
      which users belong to which security groups, enabling role-based access control.
      
      This model serves as the junction table between users and their assigned security
      groups, implementing the many-to-many relationship between users and groups. It is
      critical for managing user permissions and access rights across the dental practice
      system.

      usage_notes: >
        - Use this model to understand user access control assignments
        - Join with stg_opendental__userod to see user details
        - Join with stg_opendental__usergroup to see group details
        - Note that creation and update timestamps are not available in source
        - All timestamps are in UTC
        - Contains PII - handle with appropriate security measures

                  in the userod table. This is expected for historical data and system
