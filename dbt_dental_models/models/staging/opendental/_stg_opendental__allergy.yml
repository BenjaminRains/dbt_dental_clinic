    description: >
      Staging model for patient allergies. Contains patient-specific allergy information 
      including reactions, status, and clinical codes.
      
      This model tracks allergies assigned to individual patients, linking to allergy 
      definitions for standardized allergen information. Each record represents a specific 
      allergy for a patient, including reaction details and whether the allergy is currently active.

      usage_notes: >
        - Join with allergydef for complete allergen information including medication references
        - Active allergies (is_active = true) are critical for clinical workflows
        - Missing adverse reaction dates are common for allergies without known reaction events
        - Consider filtering by is_active for current allergy lists in clinical contexts
