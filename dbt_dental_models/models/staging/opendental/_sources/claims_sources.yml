              Note: OpenDental uses '0001-01-01' as a sentinel value when DateService is not provided.
              The clean_opendental_date() macro converts this to NULL, and claims with NULL DateService
              are filtered out in staging models that require date >= '2023-01-01'. This means claimprocs
              associated with claims that have missing DateService values may be excluded from downstream
              models even if the claimproc has a valid ProcDate.
