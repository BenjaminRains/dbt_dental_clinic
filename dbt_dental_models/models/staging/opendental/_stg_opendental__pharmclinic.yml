      Staging model for pharmacy-clinic relationships from OpenDental. This junction table establishes 
      many-to-many relationships between pharmacies and clinics, enabling clinics to work with multiple 
      preferred pharmacies and pharmacies to serve multiple clinic locations. Used primarily for 
      prescription routing and pharmacy preference management in clinical workflows.

      usage_notes: >
        This is a simple junction table for many-to-many relationships. When analyzing pharmacy 
        preferences, join with both pharmacy and clinic staging tables to get full context. 
        Some relationships may be historical and reference inactive pharmacies or clinics.

    tests:
      # Ensure unique pharmacy-clinic combinations
      - unique:
          column_name: "concat(pharmacy_id, '_', clinic_id)"
    
    columns:
      - name: pharm_clinic_id
        description: >
          Primary key - Unique identifier for each pharmacy-clinic relationship record 
          (maps to PharmClinicNum in OpenDental). Auto-generated sequential ID that serves 
          as the surrogate key for this junction table.
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
          - positive_values

      - name: pharmacy_id
        description: >
          Foreign key to the pharmacy table - Links to the specific pharmacy in this 
          relationship (maps to PharmacyNum in OpenDental). Establishes which pharmacy 
          is available to the clinic for prescription routing and patient referrals.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - relationships:
              to: ref('stg_opendental__pharmacy')
              field: pharmacy_id
              severity: warn  # Some historical relationships may reference inactive pharmacies

      - name: clinic_id
        description: >
          Foreign key to the clinic table - Links to the specific clinic in this 
          relationship (maps to ClinicNum in OpenDental). Identifies which clinic location 
          has access to work with the specified pharmacy. A clinic_id of 0 indicates 
          the main/default clinic location. May be NULL if clinic reference is invalid.
          Note: clinic_id can be NULL due to transform_id_columns macro treating 0 as NULL.
          No relationship test to clinic table as it may not be in staging yet.
