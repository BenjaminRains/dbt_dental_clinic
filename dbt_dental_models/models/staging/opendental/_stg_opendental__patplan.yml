      Staging model for patient insurance plan assignments that links patients to their insurance subscriptions.
      This table manages the relationship between patients and their insurance plans, including plan priority 
      (primary, secondary, etc.) and coverage details. Each record represents a specific insurance plan 
      assignment for a patient, enabling proper insurance billing and claims processing.

      usage_notes: >
        This model is essential for insurance billing workflows and patient coverage analysis.
        Use in conjunction with stg_opendental__inssub and stg_opendental__insplan for complete 
        insurance coverage information. The ordinal field is critical for determining billing 
        sequence. Be aware that historical data before 2023 is filtered out for performance.
