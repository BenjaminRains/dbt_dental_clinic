    description: >
      Staging model for allergy definitions. Contains standardized allergy definitions and their associated codes
      for use in patient allergy tracking. This model provides the reference catalog of available allergens
      that can be assigned to patients.
      
      Business Context:
      - Serves as the master catalog for allergen definitions used across the practice
      - Links medication-based allergies to the medication table for standardized drug allergy tracking
      - Supports both medication allergies (linked via medication_id) and non-medication allergies (environmental, materials, food)
      - Enables SNOMED CT coding for standardized clinical reporting and interoperability
      - UNII codes provide precise ingredient identification for medication allergies
      - Common dental allergens include local anesthetics, latex, and penicillin/antibiotics
      
      Data Scope:
      - Contains both active and hidden allergy definitions
      - Includes medication-based allergies (medication_id > 0) and general categories (medication_id = 0)
      - Covers materials (latex, acrylic), environmental allergens, food allergies, and drug categories
      - Historical and current allergy definitions maintained for patient safety continuity

      record_count: "~50-100 allergy definitions"
      data_scope: "All allergy definitions from OpenDental system"

      business_rules:
        - rule: "Medication-based allergies (medication_id > 0) must link to valid medications in the medication table"
          impact: "Critical for drug interaction checking and clinical decision support"
        - rule: "Hidden allergy definitions (is_hidden = true) should not be available for new patient assignments"
          impact: "Maintains clean allergy selection lists for clinical staff"
        - rule: "Common dental allergens (latex, local anesthetics, penicillin) require special attention in clinical workflows"
          impact: "Essential for patient safety during dental procedures"
      
      usage_notes: >
        - Join with stg_opendental__allergy to see patient-specific allergy assignments
        - medication_id = 0 indicates non-medication allergies (environmental, materials, food categories)
        - medication_id > 0 links to specific medications for drug allergy tracking
        - is_hidden = true indicates deprecated or inactive allergy definitions
        - SNOMED codes enable standardized clinical reporting and system interoperability
        - Consider filtering by is_hidden = false for active allergy selection lists
