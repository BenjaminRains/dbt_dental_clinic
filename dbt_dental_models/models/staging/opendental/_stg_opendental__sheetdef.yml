    description: >
      Staging model for sheet definition records from OpenDental. Contains template information for forms, documents, and other sheet-based records.
      
      This model includes:
      - Sheet template definitions and properties
      - Layout specifications (dimensions, orientation, fonts)
      - Page configuration settings
      - Mobile and print settings
      - Document category associations
      
      Key relationships:
      - One-to-many relationship with sheet records
      - One-to-many relationship with sheet field definitions
    
    meta:
      record_count: "Approximately 100-200 records (varies by clinic)"
      data_scope: "All active and historical sheet definitions"

          test: "sheetdef_description_not_null"
      
      business_rules:
        - rule: "Sheet definitions must have valid dimensions (width and height)"
          impact: "Affects form rendering and printing"
        - rule: "Sheet type must be a valid integer value"
          impact: "Determines how the sheet is processed and displayed"
      
      usage_notes: >
        - Use this model to understand available form templates and their properties
        - Check is_multi_page flag when working with multi-page forms
        - Consider has_mobile_layout when building mobile interfaces
        - Review auto_check_save_image settings for document management
