    description: >
      Staging model for appointments from the OpenDental system. Contains normalized and cleaned 
      appointment data with standardized naming conventions for dental practice scheduling and workflow management.
      
      Business Context:
      - Central to dental practice operations supporting scheduling, capacity planning, and patient flow management
      - Includes both completed appointments (historical data) and scheduled appointments (future planning)
      - Tracks complete patient journey from scheduling through arrival, seating, and dismissal
      - Links appointments to procedures, providers, operatories, and insurance plans for comprehensive practice management
      - Supports hygiene workflows, new patient processing, and appointment type categorization
      - Critical for practice analytics, provider productivity, and patient care coordination
      
      Data Scope:
      - Contains all appointments from 2023-01-01 onwards with incremental updates
      - Includes future-dated appointments for treatment planning and capacity management
      - Covers all appointment statuses: scheduled, completed, broken/missed, and unscheduled
      - Links to patients, providers, operatories, appointment types, and insurance plans
      - Historical changes tracked separately in histappointment table

        - rule: "Scheduled appointments (status = 1) can be future-dated to support treatment planning"
          impact: "Enables capacity planning and patient scheduling workflows"
        - rule: "Broken/Missed appointments (status = 5) should have procedure descriptions for workflow analysis"

      usage_notes: >
        - Future appointments are essential for scheduling and capacity planning - do not filter out
        - Use appointment_status to filter by workflow state: 1=Scheduled, 2=Completed, 5=Broken/Missed
        - Patient flow analysis requires arrival_datetime, seated_datetime, and dismissed_datetime
        - Join with procedurelog for detailed procedure information and billing analysis
        - is_hygiene flag distinguishes hygiene appointments from general dental procedures
        - operatory_id and provider_id enable resource utilization and capacity analysis
