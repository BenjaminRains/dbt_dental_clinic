    description: >
      Standardized provider information from OpenDental. Contains basic provider
      data transformations and standardized field naming for healthcare providers
      including dentists, hygienists, assistants, and administrative staff.
      
      This model serves as the foundation for provider-related analysis and is used
      throughout the dbt project for provider identification, scheduling, billing,
      and clinical reporting. Business logic and derived fields (like provider 
      status flags) are available in int_provider_profile intermediate model.

      usage_notes: >
        Key considerations for using provider data:
        - Always exclude provider_id = 0 when analyzing actual provider performance
        - Check is_hidden flag when creating current provider lists
        - Provider specialty affects fee schedules and billing codes
        - Termination dates indicate when providers left the practice
        - Boolean fields are converted from OpenDental's smallint format (0/1) to true booleans
