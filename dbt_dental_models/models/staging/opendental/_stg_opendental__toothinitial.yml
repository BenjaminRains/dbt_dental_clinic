    description: >
      Staging model for tooth initial data from OpenDental. Tracks initial conditions and
      movements of teeth, including their type, movement patterns, and visual representations.
      This model supports orthodontic treatment planning and progress tracking.

      usage_notes: >
        This model is used for tracking initial tooth positions and movements in orthodontic cases.
        Key considerations:
        - Tooth numbers may be in different formats:
          * Standard dental notation (1-32)
          * Letter notation (A-T)
          * Some non-standard numbers (51, 57, 58, 66, 67, 70, 71, 77, 78, 79)
        - Movement patterns are used for treatment planning
        - Drawing information supports visual representation in dental software
        - Color codes and segments are used for treatment visualization
