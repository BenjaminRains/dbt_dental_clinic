    description: >
      Staging model for OpenDental autocodes - a reference lookup table containing dental procedure 
      autocodes and their attributes. Autocodes are used in OpenDental to define automated 
      procedure coding rules and treatment planning logic.
      
      This is a small, relatively static reference table containing standardized dental procedure 
      autocodes with flags for visibility and procedure invasiveness levels. The table supports 
      clinical workflow automation and procedure categorization within the dental practice management system.
    
    meta:
      # Data quality and business context

        - rule: "Less intrusive procedures (is_less_intrusive=true) may have different treatment planning priorities"
          impact: "Influences automated treatment sequencing and patient care protocols"
      
      usage_notes: >
        This is a reference/lookup table primarily used for joining with clinical procedure data.
        Use for procedure categorization and clinical workflow logic. The small size (~37 records) 
        makes this suitable for broadcasting in joins. Note that this table has no audit trail 
        metadata due to its reference nature - only _loaded_at is tracked.

    columns:
      - name: autocode_id
        description: >
          Primary key for the autocode table - unique identifier for each dental procedure autocode 
          (maps to AutoCodeNum in OpenDental source system). Used for joining with clinical procedure 
          records and treatment planning data.
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
          - positive_values

      - name: description
        description: >
          Human-readable description of the autocode and its clinical purpose. Provides context 
          for dental professionals about the autocode's intended use in procedure coding and 
          treatment planning workflows.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: is_hidden
        description: >
          Boolean flag indicating if the autocode should be hidden from normal user interfaces 
          and procedure selection lists (0=Visible, 1=Hidden converted to boolean). Hidden autocodes 
          may be deprecated or for internal system use only.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - boolean_values

      - name: is_less_intrusive
        description: >
          Boolean flag indicating if procedures associated with this autocode are considered 
          less intrusive or minimally invasive (0=Standard invasiveness, 1=Less intrusive converted to boolean). 
          Used in treatment planning algorithms to prioritize less invasive treatment options.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - boolean_values

      - name: _loaded_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the data was loaded into the data warehouse by the ETL pipeline 
          (using current_timestamp). This is the only audit metadata available for this 
          reference table as it lacks created/updated tracking in the source system.
        tests:
          - not_null
