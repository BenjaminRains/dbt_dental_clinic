      Standardized procedure notes from the OpenDental dental practice management system.
      
      This model contains clinical notes and digital signatures associated with dental procedures.
      Each record represents a clinical note created by a dental professional during or after a procedure,
      capturing important clinical observations, treatment details, and outcomes. These notes are essential
      for clinical documentation, continuity of care, and regulatory compliance. The model includes both
      text notes and digital signature data when electronic signature pads are used.

        Key considerations for analysts:
        - Use patient_id and procedure_id to link notes to specific treatments and patients
        - Note content may contain PHI - ensure appropriate data handling and access controls
        - is_topaz_signature indicates use of electronic signature pad for authentication
        - entry_timestamp shows documentation timing, which may differ from treatment timing
        - user_id may reference deactivated users for historical records
        - Signature field contains binary data that requires specialized tools for interpretation

          Date and time when this clinical note was entered into the system.
          
          Business Context:
          - Represents documentation timing, not necessarily when treatment occurred
          - Used for audit trails and clinical documentation compliance
          - May be entered during treatment or shortly after completion

          Text content of the clinical note containing procedure details, observations, and outcomes.
          
          Data Quality Notes:
          - May contain Protected Health Information (PHI) requiring appropriate handling
          - Content varies from brief status updates to detailed clinical observations
          - Empty or whitespace-only notes may indicate incomplete documentation
          
          Usage Considerations:
          - Ensure appropriate access controls when analyzing note content
          - Consider note length and content quality when using for clinical insights
          - Text analysis should account for medical terminology and abbreviations

          Technical Notes:
          - Contains binary signature data in text format
          - Requires specialized software for signature verification and display
          - Presence indicates electronic authentication of the clinical note
          - NULL when no electronic signature was captured
          
          Business Context:
          - Provides legal authentication for clinical documentation
          - Important for regulatory compliance and audit requirements
          - Enhances clinical note integrity and non-repudiation
