    description: >
      Standardized staging model for clinic/location information from OpenDental.
      This model provides location and operational details for dental clinic facilities,
      including addresses, contact information, billing settings, and operational preferences.
      
      **IMPORTANT**: This model is currently a shell/placeholder and is NOT in active use
      by the MDC clinic. The source OpenDental data is not being extracted or loaded,
      and the ETL pipeline has not been configured for this table. This model exists
      as a template for potential future implementation if MDC clinic expands to
      multiple locations or begins using the clinic functionality in OpenDental.

        **SHELL MODEL NOTICE**: This model is not currently active and contains no data.
        It serves as a template for future implementation if MDC clinic expands to
        multiple locations. The model structure follows OpenDental's clinic table
        schema and includes all necessary fields for location management, billing
        configuration, and operational settings. If activated, this model would
        support multi-location reporting, provider assignment, and location-specific
        billing configurations. All tests are currently configured but not running
        due to the absence of source data extraction.
