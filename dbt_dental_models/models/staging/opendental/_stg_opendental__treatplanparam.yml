    description: >
      Staging model for treatment plan display parameters and settings from OpenDental.
      Each record contains configuration options for how a treatment plan should be displayed
      and what information should be shown to patients and staff.
      
      This model supports the treatment plan presentation layer, controlling which elements
      are visible in the treatment plan view. All boolean flags are converted from OpenDental's
      0/1 format to true/false for consistency.

      usage_notes: >
        - All boolean flags are converted from OpenDental's 0/1 format to true/false
        - Source lacks timestamps, so metadata uses current_timestamp
        - Display parameters control what information is shown in treatment plan views
        - Parameters can be customized per treatment plan to control presentation
