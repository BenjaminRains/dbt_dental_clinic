    description: >
      Staging model for insurance verification history records. This model tracks the 
      chronological history of insurance verification activities, providing an audit trail 
      of when verifications were performed, by whom, and for which insurance subscribers or plans.
      
      Each record represents a single verification event in the system's history, with 
      verify_type determining whether it relates to insurance subscribers (type 1) or 
      insurance plans (type 2). The model enables tracking of verification workflows, 
      assignment patterns, and user activity over time.

      usage_notes: >
        This model should be used for audit and tracking purposes rather than current 
        verification status. For current verification status, use stg_opendental__insverify.
        When analyzing verification patterns, be aware that system-generated records 
        (user_id = 0) represent automated processes and may have different data completeness.

          Data Quality Note: 1,987 history records do not have corresponding verification 
          records. These are primarily created by users 57 and 9282 and represent specific 
          verification workflows where history is maintained separately.

          Data Quality Note: 19,630 records have null values representing system-generated 
          verification activities. These are primarily created by automated processes and 
          should not have an associated user. This is expected behavior.

          Maps to FKey in OpenDental with 0 converted to null.
          
          Data Quality Note: 983 Type 1 records do not have corresponding subscriber 
          records, and 1,946 records have mismatches with their verification records. 
          This is due to verification workflows that maintain history separately 
          or represent different time points in the verification lifecycle.

        description: >
          Date when the verification was last assigned to a user. This tracks assignment 
          rather than completion.
          
          Data Quality Note: 19,613 system-generated records (user_id = 0) have null 
          values. These are primarily created by verify users 9282 and 57 with dates 
          ranging from 2020-04-28 to 2025-02-28. This is expected for automated 
          verification scheduling.
