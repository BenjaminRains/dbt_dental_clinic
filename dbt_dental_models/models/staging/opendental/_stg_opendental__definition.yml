    description: >
      Staging model for OpenDental definitions table. Contains system configuration definitions 
      that define categories, display options, colors, and other configurable elements used 
      throughout the OpenDental system.
      
      This table stores various types of system definitions including appointment confirmation types,
      adjustment types, diagnosis codes, treatment plan priorities, payment types, and other
      categorized configuration items. Each definition belongs to a category and can have 
      associated display properties like colors and ordering.

      usage_notes: >
        This table is essential for understanding system configuration and should be joined
        with other tables that reference definition categories. Pay attention to the category_id
        field to understand what type of definition each record represents. Hidden definitions
        may still be referenced by historical records, so filtering should be done carefully
        based on analysis needs.

    columns:
      - name: definition_id
        description: >
          Primary key of the definition table - unique identifier for each system definition 
          (maps to DefNum in OpenDental). Used throughout the system to reference specific 
          configuration items and maintain referential integrity.
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
          - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
              expression: ">= 1"

      - name: category_id
        description: >
          Category identifier that groups related definitions together. Different categories
          represent different types of system configurations (e.g., appointment types,
          adjustment categories, payment types). Critical for understanding the business
          context of each definition. May be null for legacy or system-level definitions.

      - name: item_order
        description: >
          Ordering sequence for items within the same category. Used to control the display
          order of options in dropdowns and lists within the OpenDental application.
          Lower numbers appear first in the interface.

      - name: item_name
        description: >
          Name or identifier of the definition item as displayed to users in the OpenDental
          interface. This is the human-readable label that appears in dropdowns, reports,
          and other UI elements.
          
          Note: Some records (particularly in category 25 - appointment types) have NULL item_name 
          values representing empty/unused appointment slots or system placeholders. This is 
          a known data quality issue in the source system.
        tests:
          - not_null:
              severity: warn

      - name: item_value
        description: >
          Additional value or setting associated with the definition item. May contain
          configuration details, codes, or other metadata specific to the definition type.
          Can be null for definitions that only require a name/display value.

      - name: item_color
        description: >
          Color value associated with the definition item for display purposes in the
          OpenDental interface. Typically stored as a color code or system color reference.
          Used for visual categorization and improved user experience.

      - name: is_hidden
        description: >
          Flag indicating if the definition item is hidden from user view in the OpenDental
          interface (0=visible, 1=hidden converted to boolean). Hidden items are retained
          for historical data integrity but not shown in current dropdowns or selection lists.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: _loaded_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when this record was loaded into the data warehouse by the ETL pipeline
          (using current_timestamp). Used for data lineage tracking and identifying when
          data was last refreshed.
        tests:
          - not_null
