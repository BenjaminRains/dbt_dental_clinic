    description: >
      Staging model for periodontal examinations from OpenDental. Each periodontal examination 
      represents a comprehensive assessment of a patient's gum health and periodontal conditions, 
      typically performed during routine dental visits or specialized periodontal consultations.
      
      This model contains the header-level information for periodontal exams, with detailed 
      measurements stored separately in stg_opendental__periomeasure. Each exam record may have 
      multiple associated periomeasure records containing specific pocket depth measurements, 
      bleeding points, and other periodontal indicators.
      
      Data scope: Records from 2023-01-01 onwards with incremental loading based on measure 
      edit timestamps.

      usage_notes: >
        This model should be joined with stg_opendental__periomeasure to get complete periodontal 
        assessment data. Use exam_date for temporal analysis of periodontal health trends. 
        The measure_edit_timestamp indicates when measurements were last modified, which may 
        differ from the original exam date. Notes field may contain important clinical observations 
        that supplement the numerical measurements.

        description: >
          Timestamp indicating when the periodontal measurements were last edited or modified 
          in the OpenDental system. This may differ from the original exam_date if measurements 
          were updated after the initial examination. Used for incremental loading logic.

        description: >
          Free-text clinical notes associated with the periodontal examination. May contain 
          important observations about gum health, treatment recommendations, or other clinical 
          findings that supplement the numerical measurements stored in periomeasure records.
