    description: >
      Staging model for employer data from OpenDental. Contains information about 
      employers including their contact details and addresses. This data is used
      for patient insurance processing, billing coordination, and employment verification.
      
      Business Context:
      - Employers are organizations that provide insurance benefits to patients
      - Used primarily for insurance claim processing and patient billing
      - Contact information is critical for insurance verification and communication
      - Data quality varies significantly due to manual data entry processes
    
    meta:
      # Data quality and business context
      record_count: "~2,000 active employers"
      data_scope: "All employer records from OpenDental system inception"
      
      known_issues:
        - description: "Many employer records have incomplete or missing contact information due to manual data entry"
          severity: "warn"
          identified_date: "2024-01-15"
          test: "non_empty_validation"
        - description: "Phone numbers are stored in various formats without standardization"
          severity: "warn"
          identified_date: "2024-01-15"
        - description: "Address fields may contain inconsistent formatting and abbreviations"
          severity: "warn"
          identified_date: "2024-01-15"
      
      business_rules:
        - rule: "Employer records are typically created when setting up patient insurance plans"
          impact: "Missing employers can block insurance claim processing"
        - rule: "Empty string values are converted to NULL for better data quality"
          impact: "Improves consistency but may affect downstream logic expecting empty strings"
      
      usage_notes: >
        Key considerations when using this model:
        - Contact information quality varies significantly - validate before use in critical processes
        - Employer names may have variations/duplicates for the same organization
        - Use with insurance-related models for complete employment verification workflows
        - Phone and address formatting is inconsistent - apply standardization in downstream models
