    description: >-
      Staging model for EOB (Explanation of Benefits) attachments from OpenDental.
      Contains file attachments associated with insurance claim payments including
      scanned documents, PDFs, and other electronic files used for claim processing
      and payment reconciliation.
      
      This model captures the relationship between claim payments and their supporting
      documentation, enabling audit trails and compliance tracking for insurance
      payment processing.

      business_rules:
        - rule: "EOB attachments are immutable once created - they cannot be updated after upload"
          impact: "_created_at and _updated_at timestamps will always be identical"
        - rule: "Base64 content should be validated for file integrity before processing"
          impact: "Raw data may contain corrupted or incomplete file data"
        - rule: "Source system timestamps use DateTCreated for both creation and update tracking"
          impact: "Since EOB attachments are immutable, both timestamps represent the same upload event"
      
      usage_notes: >
        When joining to claim payments, filter for dates >= 2023-01-01 to maintain
        referential integrity. Relationship test warnings may occur for EOB attachments
        referencing claim payments with CheckDate < 2023-01-01 or for attachments
        without corresponding claim payments in the source system.
        
        The raw_base64 column contains large binary data and should be excluded from
        most analytical queries unless specifically needed for file processing.

        description: >
          Name of the attached file including extension. Typically contains EOB PDFs,
          scanned documents, or other supporting documentation for claim payments.
          Used for file identification and organization in the document management system.

          Base64 encoded content of the attached file. Contains the complete file data
          for EOB documents, PDFs, images, and other attachment types. This column
          contains large binary data and should be excluded from most analytical queries
          unless specifically needed for file processing or extraction.
      
      # Source System Timestamp Columns
      - name: _created_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the EOB attachment was created in the source system (OpenDental).
          Maps to DateTCreated column. Since EOB attachments are immutable once created,
          this represents the upload timestamp for the file.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
              expression: ">= '2020-01-01'"
      
      - name: _updated_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the EOB attachment was last updated in the source system (OpenDental).
          Maps to DateTCreated column. Since EOB attachments are immutable, this will
          always equal _created_at.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
              expression: "= _created_at"
