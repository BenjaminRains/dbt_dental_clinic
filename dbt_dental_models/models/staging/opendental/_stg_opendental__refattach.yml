      Staging model for referral attachments. 
      
      This table contains information about referrals linked to patients, procedures, and providers in OpenDental. It is used to track the lifecycle and context of patient referrals, including their association with procedures, providers, and referral types. The model supports clinical and operational reporting on referral activity, transitions of care, and provider engagement.

        - Not all referral attachments are linked to procedures or providers; see business rules and known issues.
        - Analysts should use referral_type and referral_to_status to filter for specific referral workflows.
        - Data is filtered to records with RefDate >= 2023-01-01.
