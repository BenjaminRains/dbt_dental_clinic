## Technical Considerations

### Frontend Technology Stack

**Current Stack** (from your frontend directory):
- React + TypeScript
- Vite build tool
- Material-UI components
- API integration to FastAPI backend

**Estimated Development Time by Component Type**:
- Simple KPI cards: 0.5-1 hour
- Data table with filtering: 2-3 hours
- Chart/visualization: 1-2 hours
- Dashboard layout: 1-2 hours
- API endpoint: 0.5-1 hour
- Testing and polish: 1-2 hours

**Per Dashboard Average**: 4-6 hours

### Backend/Mart Development

**Current Stack** (from your dbt project):
- dbt with PostgreSQL
- 150+ existing models to reference
- Comprehensive testing framework
- Well-documented intermediate layer

**Estimated Development Time by Mart Complexity**:
- Simple mart (single source): 4-6 hours
- Medium mart (2-3 sources): 8-10 hours
- Complex mart (4+ sources, complex logic): 12-16 hours

### Data Refresh Strategy

**Current Approach** (from exposures.yml):
- Manual refresh (user-initiated dbt runs)
- **Planned**: Automated daily refresh at 6:00 AM via Airflow

**With Airflow** (when implemented):
```
3:00 AM: ETL Pipeline DAG runs
  ‚Üì Populates PostgreSQL raw schema
6:00 AM: dbt Build DAG runs
  ‚Üì Transforms raw ‚Üí marts
7:00 AM: Dashboards show fresh data
```

**Latency**: T+1 day for most metrics (acceptable for daily operations)

---

## Prioritization Framework

### Decision Criteria for Build Order

**1. Backend Readiness** (Does mart exist?)
- ‚úÖ Mart exists ‚Üí Quick win (4-6 hours)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs enhancement ‚Üí Medium effort (8-10 hours)
- ‚ùå New mart ‚Üí Higher effort (12-16 hours)

**2. Operational Impact** (How often will it be used?)
- **Daily**: High priority (AR aging, claims)
- **Weekly**: Medium priority (treatment plans, hygiene)
- **Monthly**: Lower priority (new patients, retention)

**3. User Count** (How many people need this?)
- **Team-wide** (10+ users): High priority
- **Department** (3-5 users): Medium priority
- **Individual** (1-2 users): Lower priority

**4. Financial Impact** (Revenue/cost effect)
- **Direct revenue**: High priority (treatment plans, claims)
- **Revenue optimization**: Medium priority (hygiene, scheduling)
- **Cost reduction**: Medium priority (collections, efficiency)

### Recommended Priority Order

- PBN: Industry benchmarking, board presentations, standard reports ($500/month)
- Your platform: Daily operations, custom analytics, deep-dive analysis ($100/month)
- Total: $600/month but best of both worlds

OR more likely:

- Your platform: Everything you actually need ($100/month)
- Savings: $400/month = $4,800/year

  - test_date_ranges_valid
```

**For Each New Dashboard**:
```yaml
Frontend Tests:
  - test_renders_without_errors
  - test_displays_correct_data
  - test_filters_work_correctly
  - test_charts_render_properly
  - test_responsive_design

Integration Tests:
  - test_api_endpoints_return_data

## Risks & Mitigation

### Development Risks

**Risk**: Time estimates too low (scope creep)
- **Mitigation**: Start with MVP, iterate
- **Mitigation**: Use existing patterns from current dashboards
- **Mitigation**: Timebox each dashboard (don't over-engineer)

**Risk**: Data quality issues discovered during development
- **Mitigation**: Contract tests catch early (you just built these!)
- **Mitigation**: Document assumptions clearly
- **Mitigation**: Build with graceful degradation

**Risk**: Maintenance burden grows over time
- **Mitigation**: Good documentation (you're doing this!)
- **Mitigation**: Automated testing (contract tests)
- **Mitigation**: Airflow automation (planned)

### Operational Risks

**Risk**: Team doesn't adopt new dashboards
- **Mitigation**: Involve users in design (ask what they need)
- **Mitigation**: Training and documentation
- **Mitigation**: Make dashboards genuinely useful (not vanity metrics)

**Risk**: Performance degradation as data grows
- **Mitigation**: Proper indexing on marts
- **Mitigation**: Incremental dbt models where appropriate
- **Mitigation**: Query optimization

**Risk**: Complexity becomes unmaintainable
- **Mitigation**: Keep dashboards simple and focused
- **Mitigation**: Don't try to match PBN's 1000 KPIs
- **Mitigation**: Build only what you'll actually use

2. **Set up development sprint**
   - Block time for Phase 1 (10-14 hours)
   - Identify user testers for each dashboard
   - Create dashboard mockups/wireframes

3. **Validate existing marts**
   - Run contract tests on `mart_ar_summary`
   - Run contract tests on `mart_new_patient`
   - Confirm data quality for dashboard use

### Week 1: AR Aging Dashboard

**Monday-Tuesday** (4-6 hours):
- Design dashboard layout
- Build API endpoints (`/ar/summary`, `/ar/aging-detail`)
- Create React components
- Test with real data

**Wednesday**:

## Conclusion

You have a **strong analytical foundation** with 17 marts and 150+ models covering 9 business systems. The gap isn't in **analytical capability** - it's in **exposing that capability** through user-friendly dashboards.

**Current Coverage**: 1/6 critical questions (17%)
**With 40 hours development**: 6/6 critical questions (100%)

**You're not competing with PBN on breadth** (their 1000 KPIs) - you're **exceeding them on depth and customization** for your specific needs.

**Key Insight**: Your 17 marts can generate 100+ KPIs easily. The question isn't "how many KPIs can we have?" but "which KPIs do we actually need to make better decisions?"

Focus on the 6 questions that matter, build the exposures that answer them, and you'll have operational parity with PBN at 1/5 the cost with unlimited upside.
