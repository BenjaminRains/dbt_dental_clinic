"""
Integration tests for TableProcessor using real database connections and provider pattern.

This module provides integration testing for the TableProcessor class using:
- AAA Pattern for clear test structure
- Real database connections with test environment
- FileConfigProvider with .env_test file for test environment
- Settings injection for environment-agnostic connections
- Order markers for proper test execution sequence
- Complete ETL pipeline validation with real data flow

Following TESTING_PLAN.md best practices:
- Integration tests with real test database connections
- FileConfigProvider with real test configuration files (.env_test)
- Settings injection for environment-agnostic connections
- Order markers for proper ETL data flow validation
- Real dental clinic data structures and schemas
