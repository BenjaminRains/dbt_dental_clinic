Contract Validation Tests

This package contains tests that verify data contracts and object structures
used throughout the ETL pipeline. These tests ensure that:

1. Configuration files (tables.yml) have correct structure
2. Objects passed between components have required fields
3. Data types are correct
4. Value ranges are valid
5. Cross-field constraints are satisfied

These tests act as executable documentation of the data contracts
and help catch schema drift or breaking changes early.
