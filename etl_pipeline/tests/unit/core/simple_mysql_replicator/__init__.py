Unit tests for SimpleMySQLReplicator using provider pattern with DictConfigProvider.

This package contains unit tests for the SimpleMySQLReplicator with pure unit tests using mocked
dependencies and provider pattern dependency injection. All tests use DictConfigProvider
for injected configuration to ensure complete test isolation.

Test Modules:
    - test_initialization: Tests for SimpleMySQLReplicator initialization
    - test_configuration: Tests for configuration methods and strategy determination
    - test_table_copy_logic: Tests for table copy logic and database operations
    - test_bulk_operations: Tests for bulk table copying operations
    - test_error_handling: Tests for error handling and exception management
    - test_integration_points: Tests for integration with other components
    - test_tracking_tables: Tests for tracking table functionality
    - test_copy_methods: Tests for copy method determination
    - test_performance_optimizations: Tests for PerformanceOptimizations class
    - test_utility_methods: Tests for utility methods (data cleaning, SQL building, etc.)
    - test_data_processing: Tests for data processing methods (tiny, small, medium, large table copying)
    - test_performance_tracking: Tests for performance tracking and reporting methods

Test Strategy:
    - Unit tests with mocked dependencies using DictConfigProvider
    - Validates provider pattern dependency injection and Settings injection
    - Tests FAIL FAST behavior when ETL_ENVIRONMENT not set
    - Ensures type safety with DatabaseType and PostgresSchema enums
    - Tests environment separation (production vs test) with provider pattern
    - Validates incremental copy logic and configuration management
    - Tests performance optimization and adaptive batch sizing
    - Tests utility methods for data cleaning and SQL generation
    - Tests performance tracking and reporting functionality

Coverage Areas:
    - SimpleMySQLReplicator initialization with Settings injection
    - Configuration loading from YAML files with provider pattern
    - Copy strategy determination based on table size
    - Incremental copy logic with change data capture
    - Error handling and logging for dental clinic ETL operations
    - Provider pattern configuration isolation and environment separation
    - Settings injection for environment-agnostic connections
    - PerformanceOptimizations class with adaptive batch sizing
    - Utility methods for data cleaning and SQL building
    - Data processing methods for different table sizes
    - Performance tracking and reporting functionality
    - Schema analyzer summary generation

ETL Context:
    - Critical for nightly ETL pipeline execution with dental clinic data
    - Supports MariaDB v11.6 source and MySQL replication database
    - Uses provider pattern for clean dependency injection and test isolation
    - Implements Settings injection for environment-agnostic connections
    - Enforces FAIL FAST security to prevent accidental production usage
    - Performance optimization for large-scale data processing
    - Comprehensive testing of all SimpleMySQLReplicator functionality
