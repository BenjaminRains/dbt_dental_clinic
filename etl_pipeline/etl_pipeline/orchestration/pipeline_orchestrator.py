Pipeline Orchestrator

Handles the core ETL pipeline orchestration, coordinating between different components
and managing the overall flow of data through the pipeline.

STATUS: ACTIVE - Core Orchestration Implementation (REFACTORED)
==============================================================

This is the current active implementation of the ETL pipeline orchestration,
serving as the main coordinator for the entire data pipeline. It's actively used
by CLI commands and represents the refactored architecture using integrated approach.

CURRENT STATE:
- ✅ ACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION: Used by CLI commands and main pipeline
- ✅ REFACTORED ARCHITECTURE: Uses integrated approach with SimpleMySQLReplicator and PostgresLoader
- ✅ EFFICIENT CONNECTION MANAGEMENT: Streamlined connection lifecycle
- ✅ CONTEXT MANAGER: Implements __enter__/__exit__ for resource cleanup
- ✅ ERROR HANDLING: Comprehensive exception handling and cleanup
- ✅ CORE FUNCTIONALITY: Focused on essential orchestration tasks
- ✅ STATIC CONFIGURATION: Uses ConfigReader for table configuration
- ❌ UNTESTED: No comprehensive integration tests

REFACTORED ARCHITECTURE:
1. Connection Management: Streamlined database connection setup
2. Component Coordination: Direct delegation to TableProcessor and PriorityProcessor
3. Pipeline Execution: Simple interface for single table or batch processing
4. Resource Management: Automatic cleanup through context manager
5. Integrated Approach: Uses SimpleMySQLReplicator and PostgresLoader via components

DEPENDENCIES:
- TableProcessor: Handles individual table processing using integrated approach
- PriorityProcessor: Manages table processing by priority using integrated approach
- Settings: Configuration management
- ConfigReader: Static configuration management
- UnifiedMetricsCollector: Basic metrics collection

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- CLI Commands: Used by cli/commands.py for pipeline execution
- Database Connections: Manages source, replication, and analytics connections
- Table Processing: Delegates to TableProcessor for individual table ETL
- Priority Processing: Uses PriorityProcessor for batch processing
- Metrics Collection: Integrates with unified metrics collector

DEVELOPMENT NEEDS:
1. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING: Add integration and unit tests
2. ERROR RECOVERY: Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION: Optimize parallel processing
4. MONITORING: Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting

This orchestrator represents the core of the ETL pipeline and has been refactored
to use the integrated approach with static configuration for better performance.
