DEPRECATION NOTICE - REFACTORING IN PROGRESS
============================================

This file is part of the ETL Pipeline Schema Analysis Refactoring Plan.
See: docs/refactor_remove_schema_discovery_from_etl.md

PLANNED CHANGES:
- ✅ UPDATED: Now uses integrated approach with SimpleMySQLReplicator and PostgresLoader
- ✅ UPDATED: Uses ConfigReader for static configuration instead of SchemaDiscovery
- ✅ UPDATED: Maintains current parallel/sequential processing logic
- ✅ UPDATED: Compatible with refactored TableProcessor
- ✅ UPDATED: Preserves process_table() interface compatibility
- ✅ UPDATED: Follows connection architecture with proper Settings injection

TIMELINE: Phase 4 of refactoring plan
STATUS: ✅ REFACTORED - Integrated approach implemented

Priority Processor

Handles table processing based on priority levels with intelligent parallelization.

STATUS: ACTIVE - Core Orchestration Component (REFACTORED)
=========================================================

This module is an active component of the orchestration framework that manages
table processing based on priority levels. It's actively used by the PipelineOrchestrator
and provides intelligent parallelization for critical tables.

CURRENT STATE:
- ✅ ACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION: Used by PipelineOrchestrator for batch processing
- ✅ INTELLIGENT PARALLELIZATION: Parallel processing for critical tables
- ✅ SEQUENTIAL PROCESSING: Sequential processing for non-critical tables
- ✅ ERROR HANDLING: Proper error handling and failure propagation
- ✅ RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel processing
- ✅ INTEGRATED APPROACH: Uses SimpleMySQLReplicator and PostgresLoader via TableProcessor
- ✅ STATIC CONFIGURATION: Uses ConfigReader for table configuration
- ✅ CONNECTION ARCHITECTURE: Follows unified interface with Settings injection
- ✅ ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION: Validates environment configuration before processing
- ❌ UNTESTED: No comprehensive testing of parallel processing

ACTIVE USAGE:
- PipelineOrchestrator: Calls process_by_priority for batch table processing
- CLI Commands: Indirectly used through orchestrator
- Orchestration Framework: Core component of the pipeline architecture

DEPENDENCIES:
- TableProcessor: Processes individual tables using integrated approach
- ThreadPoolExecutor: Manages parallel processing
- ConfigReader: Uses static configuration for table priority lookup
- Settings: Uses Settings class for table priority lookup with proper environment detection
- ConnectionFactory: Uses unified interface for database connections

PROCESSING LOGIC:
1. Priority Levels: critical, important, audit, reference
2. Critical Tables: Processed in parallel for speed
3. Other Tables: Processed sequentially to manage resources
4. Failure Handling: Stops processing if critical tables fail
5. Resource Management: Configurable max_workers for parallel processing
6. Environment Validation: Validates configuration before processing

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- PipelineOrchestrator: Main integration point for batch processing
- TableProcessor: Delegates individual table processing using integrated approach
- ConfigReader: Uses static configuration for table priority lookup
- Settings: Uses modern Settings system for table priority lookup with environment detection
- ConnectionFactory: Uses unified interface for database connections
- Logging: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. UNTESTED PARALLEL PROCESSING: No validation of parallel processing logic
2. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: No validation of thread pool management
3. ERROR PROPAGATION: Limited testing of failure scenarios

DEVELOPMENT NEEDS:
1. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING: Add tests for parallel and sequential processing
2. PERFORMANCE TESTING: Validate parallel processing performance
3. ERROR HANDLING: Test failure scenarios and error propagation
4. RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION: Optimize thread pool management
5. MONITORING: Add performance metrics for parallel processing

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Parallel Processing: Test with various worker counts and table sets
2. Sequential Processing: Test sequential processing logic
3. Error Scenarios: Test failure handling and error propagation
4. Resource Management: Test thread pool cleanup and resource usage
5. Performance: Test processing time with different configurations
6. Integration: Test integration with TableProcessor and PipelineOrchestrator
7. Environment Validation: Test environment configuration validation

This component is critical for efficient batch processing and has been refactored
to use the integrated approach with static configuration and proper connection architecture.
