"""
Notification functionality for the ETL pipeline.

STATUS: PREMATURE - Unnecessary Complexity for MVP
=================================================

This module provides notification functionality that is premature for the current
ETL pipeline development stage. It adds unnecessary complexity before the core
pipeline is minimally viable.

CURRENT STATE:
- ✅ WELL-STRUCTURED: Clean dataclass and manager pattern
- ✅ TYPE HINTS: Proper type annotations
- ✅ CONFIGURABLE: Supports multiple notification channels
- ❌ PREMATURE: Not needed until pipeline is MVP
- ❌ UNUSED: Only imported but not actively used
- ❌ COMPLEXITY: Adds unnecessary abstraction layer
- ❌ DEPENDENCIES: Will require external service integrations

ACTIVE USAGE:
- cli/commands.py: Imported but not used
- utils/__init__.py: Exported for potential use
- main.py: References alert_manager (which doesn't exist)

INTEGRATION ISSUES:
- main.py references alert_manager.send_pipeline_alert() but alerts.py doesn't exist
- NotificationManager is imported but never instantiated or used
- No actual notification channels implemented (email, slack, teams, webhook)

DEVELOPMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. REMOVE: Delete this module until pipeline is MVP
2. SIMPLIFY: Use basic logging instead of complex notification system
3. POSTPONE: Implement notifications after core pipeline is working
4. FOCUS: Concentrate on core ETL functionality first

MVP APPROACH:
- Use simple print() statements for debugging
- Use logging for pipeline events
- Add notifications only after pipeline is proven to work
- Start with basic email notifications, not complex multi-channel system

This module represents premature optimization and should be removed
to reduce complexity and focus on core ETL functionality.
