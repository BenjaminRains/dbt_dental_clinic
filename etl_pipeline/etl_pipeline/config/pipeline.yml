# Pipeline configuration for the dental clinic ETL pipeline
#
# WORKING CONFIGURATION - TESTED AND VALIDATED
# ===========================================
# This file contains the actual configuration used by the ETL pipeline.
# All settings below are implemented and tested in the codebase.
#
# Database connection settings are loaded from environment variables
# and can be overridden here. See .env.template for required variables.

# General pipeline settings
general:
  pipeline_name: "dental_clinic_etl"
  environment: "production"
  timezone: "UTC"
  max_retries: 3
  retry_delay_seconds: 300
  batch_size: 100000  # Increased for better performance (from 50000)
  parallel_jobs: 8    # Increased for better throughput (from 6)

# Performance category-specific settings
performance_categories:
  tiny:
    batch_size: 5000      # Small batches for tiny tables (< 10K records)
    timeout_minutes: 5     # Quick timeout for tiny tables
    retry_delay_seconds: 60
  small:
    batch_size: 25000     # Medium batches for small tables (10K-100K records)
    timeout_minutes: 15    # Moderate timeout for small tables
    retry_delay_seconds: 120
  medium:
    batch_size: 50000     # Large batches for medium tables (100K-1M records)
    timeout_minutes: 30    # Standard timeout for medium tables
    retry_delay_seconds: 300
  large:
    batch_size: 100000    # Extra large batches for large tables (> 1M records)
    timeout_minutes: 60    # Extended timeout for large tables
    retry_delay_seconds: 600

# Database connection overrides
# These settings override the default connection parameters loaded from environment variables
