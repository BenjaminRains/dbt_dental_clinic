# DBT Dental Practice Analytics Platform

## Overview

The DBT Dental Practice project is an analytics engineering initiative that transforms OpenDental 
operational data into validated, standardized datasets for analytics and machine learning 
applications. This project transforms OpenDental's operational (OLTP) database into an 
analytics-ready (OLAP) data platform using DBT. By restructuring the data model, we enable advanced 
analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence capabilities while maintaining data integrity
 and standardization. This project serves as the foundation for improving dental clinic operations, 
 financial performance, patient care, and data-driven decision making.

## Why OLTP to OLAP Transformation?

### 1. Operational Benefits
- **Performance Optimization**: Separate analytical queries from transactional systems
- **Data Quality Improvement**: Standardized validation catches data entry issues early
- **Historical Analysis**: Preserve full history of changes for trend analysis
- **Cross-System Integration**: Enable unified view across multiple dental practices
- **Validate database integrity** through comprehensive testing and documentation using dbt-core

### 2. Business Process Enhancement
- **Process Mining**: Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Workflow Analysis**: Track end-to-end patient journeys
- **Resource Utilization**: Optimize staff scheduling and equipment usage
- **Revenue Cycle Management**: Improve financial forecasting and AR management

### 3. Analytics Capabilities
- **Predictive Analytics**:
  - Patient no-show prediction
  - Treatment plan acceptance likelihood
  - Revenue forecasting
  - Insurance claim processing time estimation
- **Operational Analytics**:
  - Chair time utilization
  - Provider productivity metrics
  - Procedure profitability analysis
  - Patient acquisition cost analysis

### 4. Data Quality & Standardization
- **Consistent Data Entry**: Enforce standardized naming and coding conventions
- **Validation Rules**: Automated checks for business rule compliance
- **Error Detection**: Early identification of data quality issues
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive data dictionary and lineage tracking

### 5. Machine Learning Applications
- **Patient Segmentation**: Personalized treatment and communication strategies
- **Treatment Outcome Prediction**: Evidence-based treatment planning
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Optimize fee schedules based on market factors
- **Automated Coding**: Assist in procedure code assignment
- **Risk Stratification**: Identify high-risk patients for preventive care

## Project Architecture

### 1. Development Workflow
The project follows the dbt (data build tool) methodology with a three-layer architecture:
Our three-phase approach ensures data quality and business rule compliance:

#### Phase 1: Analysis
- Start with table DDL as ground truth
- Iterative exploratory analysis in dedicated directories
- Stakeholder collaboration for pattern identification
- Documentation of business rules and data patterns

#### Phase 2: Validation
- Convert analysis findings to automated tests
- Implement comprehensive validation rules
- Verify data integrity and relationships
- Document validation results

#### Phase 3: Implementation
- Create standardized staging models
- Apply business rules and transformations
- Implement testing framework
- Deploy to production

Major Business Systems: 
1. **System A: Fee Processing & Verification**
   - Setting and validating procedure fees
   - Managing fee schedules and contracted rates
   
2. **System B: Insurance Processing**
   - Claims creation and submission
   - Insurance payment estimation
   - Claim tracking and resolution

3. **System C: Payment Allocation & Reconciliation**
   - Payment processing and allocation
   - Managing payment splits across procedures
   - Transaction validation and reconciliation

4. **System D: AR Analysis**
   - Accounts receivable aging categorization
   - AR metric monitoring and alerting

5. **System E: Collection Process**
   - Managing outstanding balance collection
   - Payment plan creation and monitoring
   - Collection escalation workflows

6. **System F: Patientâ€“Clinic Communications**

2. **Pattern Documentation**: Identifying and documenting data patterns
3. **Model Implementation**: Creating standardized dbt models
4. **Test Development**: Implementing data quality tests
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive validation documentation
