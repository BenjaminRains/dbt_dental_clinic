# Dental Practice DBT Project - Staging Models Status and Plan

## Current State (as of [Current Date])

### Overview
Our staging layer is now complete and stable with all models successfully compiling and passing tests. The layer provides standardized, 
cleaned data from OpenDental source tables. All models follow consistent naming conventions and 
implement standard transformations.

### Implemented Features
1. **Temporal Scope**
   - All models filter for records from 2023-01-01 onwards
   - Incremental loading implemented for all relevant models

2. **Standard Transformations**
   - CamelCase to snake_case field naming conversion
   - Consistent data type handling
   - NULL handling for zero-value IDs
   - Boolean standardization
   - Timestamp standardization

3. **Model Structure**
   - All models prefixed with `stg_opendental__`
   - Consistent CTE pattern using Source â†’ Renamed structure
   - Metadata fields (_loaded_at) added

### Current Configuration
- **Source System**: OpenDental v24.3.35.0
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (migrated from MySQL)
- **Update Frequency**: Daily incremental updates
- **Primary Location**: models/staging/opendental/

### Testing Status
- **Implemented Tests**
  - Primary key uniqueness
  - Not null constraints
  - Date range validations
  - Basic relationship checks
  - All tests are currently passing

### Documentation Status
- YML files created for all models
- Column descriptions implemented
- Source definitions complete

## Next Steps

### 1. Performance Optimization
1. Review and optimize incremental logic
2. Analyze and improve query performance
3. Implement appropriate indexing strategies

### 2. Documentation Enhancement
1. Complete any missing column descriptions
2. Add business context where needed
3. Document known data quality issues

### 3. Monitoring Implementation
1. Set up freshness checks
2. Implement volume monitoring
3. Add distribution checks for key metrics

## Maintenance Plan
- Regular review of test results
- Monthly performance analysis
- Quarterly review of business rules
- Documentation updates as needed

## Dependencies
- Required for intermediate model development
- Supports direct operational reporting
- Feeds data quality monitoring systems
