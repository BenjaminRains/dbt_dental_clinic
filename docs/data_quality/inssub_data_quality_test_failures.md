# OpenDental Data Quality Assessment Report

**Date:** May 23, 2025  
**System:** OpenDental EHR - Dental Clinic ETL Pipeline  
**Assessment Period:** dbt test run results  
**Total Tests:** 50 (41 PASS, 2 WARN, 7 ERROR)

---

## Executive Summary

Our dbt data quality tests have identified **7 critical data integrity issues** affecting 2,213 records across multiple tables. The primary concern is missing and invalid insurance subscriber data, which creates cascading referential integrity problems throughout the system. Immediate remediation is required to ensure accurate insurance claim processing and patient billing.

## Critical Data Quality Issues (Errors)

### 1. Missing Insurance Effective Dates
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Records Affected:** 943  
**Table:** `stg_opendental__inssub`  
**Issue:** Insurance subscriber records have NULL effective dates  
**Business Impact:** 
- Cannot determine when insurance coverage begins
- Claims may be denied due to missing coverage dates
- Patient billing accuracy compromised

**Recommended Action:** Investigate source data extraction process and implement NULL date handling logic

### 2. Invalid Historical Effective Dates  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Records Affected:** 20  
**Table:** `stg_opendental__inssub`  
**Issue:** Effective dates before January 1, 2000  
**Business Impact:**
- Historically invalid insurance records may cause reporting errors
- Data integrity concerns for legacy patient records

**Recommended Action:** Review date validation rules and consider historical data cleanup

### 3. Date Logic Inconsistency
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Records Affected:** 1  
**Table:** `stg_opendental__inssub`  
**Issue:** Termination date occurs before effective date  
**Business Impact:**
- Logical impossibility indicates data entry or processing error
- May cause insurance claim processing failures

**Recommended Action:** Implement source system validation to prevent future occurrences

### 4. Orphaned Insurance Verification Records
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Records Affected:** 1,266 (283 current + 983 historical)  
**Tables:** `stg_opendental__insverify`, `stg_opendental__insverifyhist`  
**Issue:** Verification records reference non-existent insurance subscriber IDs  
**Business Impact:**
- Insurance verification workflow disrupted
- Compliance tracking incomplete
- Potential regulatory audit failures

**Recommended Action:** Data cleanup required - remove orphaned records or restore missing subscriber data

### 5. Broken Patient Plan References
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Records Affected:** 2  
**Table:** `stg_opendental__patplan`  
**Issue:** Patient plan records reference non-existent insurance subscribers  
**Business Impact:**
- Patient insurance assignment errors
- Billing workflow disruptions

**Recommended Action:** Investigate and correct patient plan assignments

### 6. Missing External Subscriber ID
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Records Affected:** 1  
**Table:** `stg_opendental__inssub`  
**Issue:** Empty subscriber external ID when data should be present  
**Business Impact:**
- Insurance claim submission may fail
- Provider-to-payer communication impacted

**Recommended Action:** Review data entry requirements and validation rules

### 7. Payment Allocation Orphans
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Records Affected:** 200  
**Table:** `int_insurance_payment_allocated`  
**Issue:** Insurance payment records reference non-existent insurance subscribers  
**Business Impact:**
- Payment tracking inaccurate
- Financial reporting compromised
- Revenue cycle management affected

**Recommended Action:** Data reconciliation between payment and subscriber systems

---

## Data Quality Warnings

### 1. Benefits Verification Coverage Gap
**Severity:** WARN  
**Records Affected:** 2 record groups  
**Test:** `insurance_verification` (verify_type=2)  
**Issue:** Poor benefits verification coverage for certain insurance plans  
**Business Impact:**
- Potential claim denials due to unverified benefits
- Treatment planning accuracy reduced

**Recommended Action:** Review benefits verification workflow and staff training

---

## Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issue:** Missing or corrupted insurance subscriber base data (`stg_opendental__inssub`)

**Contributing Factors:**
1. Source system data extraction issues
2. Overly restrictive date filtering in staging models
3. Lack of referential integrity constraints in source system
4. Insufficient data validation during ETL processing

**Cascade Effect:** Insurance subscriber data issues create referential integrity failures across verification, patient plans, and payment systems.

---

## Recommended Remediation Plan

### Immediate Actions (1-2 days)
1. **Data Triage:** Identify and temporarily exclude problematic records from production reporting
2. **Source Investigation:** Examine OpenDental database for missing subscriber records
3. **ETL Review:** Validate staging model filters and transformation logic

### Short-term Actions (1-2 weeks)
1. **Data Cleanup:** Correct or remove invalid date records
2. **Referential Integrity:** Restore missing subscriber records or clean orphaned references  
3. **Validation Enhancement:** Implement additional data quality checks in ETL pipeline

### Long-term Actions (1-3 months)
1. **Source System Improvements:** Work with OpenDental administrators to implement data validation
2. **Monitoring Dashboard:** Create ongoing data quality monitoring and alerting
3. **Process Documentation:** Establish data quality standards and procedures
