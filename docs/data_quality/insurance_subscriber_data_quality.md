# Insurance Subscriber Data Quality Report

## Overview
This document outlines data quality issues identified in the insurance subscriber data (`stg_opendental__inssub`). These issues could impact insurance claim processing, coverage validation, and business reporting.

## Critical Issues

### Missing Effective Dates
**Severity**: High  
**Impact**: Critical for insurance coverage validation and claim processing

#### Description
Multiple insurance subscriber records are missing effective dates (`effective_date`) despite being marked as ACTIVE. This is a violation of both data model constraints and business logic requirements.

#### Current State
- Over 100 records identified with NULL `effective_date`
- All affected records are marked as ACTIVE
- Records span from 2020 to 2025
- Some records have future dates (2025) for both creation and updates
- All affected records have NULL `termination_date`

#### Business Impact
1. **Coverage Validation**: Cannot accurately determine when insurance coverage begins
2. **Claim Processing**: May lead to incorrect claim submissions or denials
3. **Reporting**: Affects accuracy of active coverage reports
4. **Compliance**: May impact regulatory reporting requirements

#### Technical Details
- Field `effective_date` is marked as `not_null` in the data model
- Current test configuration:
  ```yaml
  - name: effective_date
    description: Date when the insurance subscription becomes effective
    tests:
      - not_null
      - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
          expression: ">= '2000-01-01'"
          config:
            severity: error
      - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
          expression: "<= current_date"
          config:
            severity: error
  ```

### Empty External IDs
**Severity**: Medium  
**Impact**: May affect insurance claim processing

#### Description
Some insurance subscriber records have empty `subscriber_external_id` values instead of either NULL or valid identifiers.

#### Current State
- At least one record identified with empty string in `subscriber_external_id`
- Most records have valid external IDs
- The empty ID record is from 2021 and marked as ACTIVE

#### Business Impact
1. **Claim Processing**: May cause issues with insurance claim submissions
2. **Data Integration**: Could affect integration with insurance carrier systems
3. **Reporting**: May impact insurance verification reports

## Recommendations

### Short-term Actions
1. **Data Cleanup**:
   - Identify and update records with missing effective dates
   - Convert empty external IDs to NULL values
   - Review and correct records with future dates

2. **Enhanced Testing**:
   - Add test for future dates in `effective_date` and `_created_at`
   - Add test for empty strings in `subscriber_external_id`
   - Add test for ACTIVE status with missing dates

### Long-term Solutions
1. **Source System Validation**:
   - Implement required field validation in the source system
   - Add date range validation for effective dates
   - Prevent creation of records with future dates

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Implement regular data quality checks
   - Create alerts for new records with missing required fields
   - Monitor for patterns of data entry issues

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update data model documentation
   - Create data entry guidelines
   - Document business rules for insurance subscriber records

## Next Steps
1. [ ] Create JIRA ticket for data cleanup
2. [ ] Update data model tests
3. [ ] Implement source system validation
4. [ ] Schedule regular data quality reviews
5. [ ] Update documentation
