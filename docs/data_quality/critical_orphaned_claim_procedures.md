# CRITICAL DATA QUALITY ISSUE: Orphaned Claim Procedure References

## Issue Summary

**Date:** January 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Billing Failures, Revenue Loss, Data Integrity  
**Status:** Open - Requires Immediate Action  

## Problem Description

**366 claim records** in the system reference **non-existent procedure IDs**. These procedure IDs do not exist in:
- The source OpenDental system (`procedurecode` table)
- The staging model (`stg_opendental__procedurecode`)
- The procedure dimension (`dim_procedure`)

This creates a **critical data integrity failure** that will cause:
- **Billing system failures** when processing these claims
- **Revenue loss** from unprocessable claims
- **Insurance claim rejections** due to invalid procedure codes
- **Financial reporting errors** and reconciliation issues

## Affected Claims Analysis

### Volume and Status:
- **Total Orphaned Claims:** 366
- **Status Distribution:**
  - S (Submitted): 206 claims
  - W (Waiting): 112 claims  
  - R (Received): 37 claims
  - H (Hold): 11 claims

### Date Range:
- **Earliest:** August 28, 2025
- **Latest:** September 26, 2025
- **All claims are recent** (within last 2 months)

**Note:** This is a sample of 20 claims. The complete list contains 366 claims with similar patterns.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Possible Causes:
1. **Data Entry Errors**: Claims created with incorrect procedure IDs
2. **System Integration Failure**: Disconnect between claim creation and procedure management
3. **Deleted Procedures**: Procedure codes deleted but claims still reference them
4. **Data Corruption**: Corrupted data in the claim creation process
5. **Incremental Loading Issues**: Procedures not properly loaded into the data warehouse

### Investigation Required:

#### For OpenDental Staff:
Since procedure IDs (1171183, 1171670, etc.) are internal database IDs not visible in the UI, staff should:

1. **Search by Claim ID**: Use the claim IDs (29690, 29683, 29692, etc.) to find these claims in OpenDental
   - Go to **Insurance → Claims** in OpenDental
   - Search for claim IDs: 29690, 29683, 29692, 29686, 29687, 29675, 29668, 29660, 29672
   - Check what procedure codes are listed for these claims

2. **Check Procedure Codes**: Look for the actual procedure codes (D-codes) in these claims
   - In the claim details, look for procedure codes like D0120, D1110, etc.
   - Verify if these procedure codes exist in **Setup → Procedure Codes**

3. **Review Recent Claims**: Focus on claims from August-September 2025
   - Check if there were any system changes during this period
   - Look for patterns in claim creation errors

#### For IT/Data Team:
- Check if these procedure IDs ever existed in the database
- Verify the claim creation process and validation rules
- Review system integration between claim and procedure management
- Check for any recent system changes or data migrations

## Business Impact

### Immediate Impact:
- **366 claims cannot be processed** for billing
- **Revenue at risk** from unprocessable claims
- **Insurance claim rejections** due to invalid procedure codes
- **Financial reporting errors** and reconciliation failures

### Long-term Impact:
- **Data integrity compromised** across the entire system
- **Trust issues** with insurance providers
- **Audit compliance problems**
- **Potential revenue loss** if not resolved quickly

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Within 24 Hours):
1. **Stop claim processing** for affected claims until resolved
2. **Identify the source** of these invalid procedure IDs
3. **Check system logs** for any errors during claim creation
4. **Verify procedure code management** processes

### Short-term (Within 1 Week):
1. **Fix the root cause** of invalid procedure ID creation
2. **Implement validation rules** to prevent future occurrences
3. **Create data correction process** for affected claims
4. **Update system integration** if needed

### Long-term (Within 1 Month):
1. **Implement comprehensive data validation** at claim creation
2. **Add referential integrity checks** in the source system
3. **Create monitoring alerts** for orphaned references
4. **Establish data quality governance** processes

## Data Correction Options

### Option 1: Map to Valid Procedures
- Identify the correct procedure codes for each claim
- Update the claims with valid procedure IDs
- Requires manual review of each claim

### Option 2: Create Missing Procedures
- Add the missing procedure codes to the system
- Requires understanding what procedures these should be
- May need clinical review

### Option 3: Void Invalid Claims
- Void claims with invalid procedure references
- Recreate claims with correct procedure codes
- Requires patient and insurance coordination

## Testing and Validation

Once resolved:
1. **Run referential integrity tests** to verify all claims have valid procedure references
2. **Test billing processes** with corrected claims
3. **Verify insurance claim submission** works correctly
4. **Check financial reporting** for accuracy
5. **Implement monitoring** to prevent future occurrences
