# OpenDental Data Entry Training Guide

## Proper Data Entry for Dental Staff

### ❌ **DO NOT** Create Patient Records For:
- **Clinics or Facilities** (like GLIC implant center)
- **Equipment or Rooms**
- **Administrative Entities**
- **Test or Demo Records**

### ✅ **DO** Create Patient Records For:
- **Actual Patients** (people receiving dental care)
- **Family Members** (each person gets their own record)
- **Staff Members** (if they are also patients)

## Common Data Entry Mistakes

### 1. **Creating "Patient" Records for Facilities**
**Problem**: Creating a patient record for GLIC (implant center)
**Solution**: Use proper facility/clinic management features in OpenDental

### 2. **Invalid Birth Dates**
**Problem**: Using `0001-01-01` as a placeholder
**Solution**: Use actual birth dates or leave blank if unknown

### 3. **Future Appointment Dates**
**Problem**: Scheduling appointments years in advance
**Solution**: Only schedule realistic appointment dates

### 4. **Missing Patient Names**
**Problem**: Leaving patient name fields empty
**Solution**: Always enter the patient's preferred name

## Data Quality Checklist

Before creating a new patient record, ask:
- [ ] Is this a real person who will receive dental care?
- [ ] Do I have their correct birth date?
- [ ] Do I have their preferred name?
- [ ] Are any appointment dates realistic?

## How to Handle Facilities/Clinics

### For GLIC (Implant Center):
- **DO NOT** create a patient record
- **DO** use OpenDental's facility management features
- **DO** create proper clinic/location records

### For Equipment or Rooms:
- **DO NOT** create patient records
