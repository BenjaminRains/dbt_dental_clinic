# Fee Analysis and Data Quality Report

## Overview
This document outlines the findings from the fee validation analysis, highlighting data quality issues, patterns, and recommendations for fee standardization.

## Validation Issues

### 1. High Fee Variations
The most common validation issue is high fee variations for the same procedures across different fee schedules.

#### Notable Variations:
- **Procedure 264**: 
  - Fee Schedule 8272: $1,239.00
  - Fee Schedule 8291: $1,950.00
  - Fee Schedule 8286: $2,517.50

- **Procedure 275 (D6060)**: 
  - Fee Schedule 8292: $1,288.00
  - Fee Schedule 8293: $250.00

- **Procedure 1650**: 
  - Fee Schedule 8292: $4,000.00
  - Fee Schedule 8293: $0.00

### 2. Underutilized Fee Schedules
Three fee schedules contain only one procedure each:

| Fee Schedule | Procedure | Fee Amount | Issue |
|--------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| 8277 | 573 | $31.00 | Single procedure |
| 8285 | 1 | $56.43 | Single procedure |
| 8290 | 6 | $11,611.00 | Known decimal error |

### 3. Concerning Patterns

#### Future-Dated Fees
Multiple fees are dated 2025-01-14 for fee schedules 8292 and 8293, including:
- Diagnostic procedures (D0180, D0474)
- Crown procedures (D6060-D6069)
- Surgical procedures (D7261, D7270)

#### Zero-Dollar Fees
Several surgical procedures have zero-dollar fees:
- D7261: $0.00 in fee schedule 8292
- D7270: $0.00 in fee schedule 8292
- D7272: $0.00 in fee schedule 8292

#### Missing ADA Codes
Some procedures lack ADA codes, particularly in fee schedules 8292 and 8293.

## Fee Schedule Analysis

- General fee schedule with moderate fees
- Contains a wide range of procedures
- Fees typically range from $116.11 to $2,517.50

### Fee Schedules 8292 and 8293

- 8293 has more zero-dollar fees
- Both contain future-dated entries

### Fee Schedule 8272

## Recommendations

1. **Fee Standardization**:
   - Review and standardize fees for procedures with high variations
   - Establish acceptable ranges for each procedure type
   - Consider creating a fee schedule hierarchy

2. **Data Quality**:
   - Investigate future-dated fees (2025-01-14)
   - Review zero-dollar fees for surgical procedures
   - Complete missing ADA codes

3. **Fee Schedule Management**:
   - Consider consolidating underutilized fee schedules
   - Review the purpose of fee schedules 8292 and 8293
   - Document the intended use of each fee schedule

4. **Validation Rules**:
   - Adjust validation thresholds based on procedure type
   - Add specific rules for surgical procedures
   - Consider adding warnings for future-dated fees

## Next Steps

1. Review and validate the purpose of each fee schedule
2. Standardize fees for procedures with high variations
3. Investigate and correct future-dated entries
4. Complete missing ADA codes
5. Consider consolidating underutilized fee schedules

## Notes
- This analysis is based on data as of March 2024
- All fees are in USD
