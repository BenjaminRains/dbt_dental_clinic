# Fee Model Data Quality Report

## Overview
This report documents data quality findings in the fee processing model (`int_fee_model`), specifically focusing on fee validation and unusual patterns identified in the data.

## Test Adjustments
- Modified fee validation test to accommodate legitimate high-value procedures:
  - Standard threshold: $0 - $10,000 for non-implant procedures
  - Implant procedure threshold: $0 - $30,000 for D6114 and D6115 procedures

## Data Quality Findings

### 1. Implant Procedures (D6114, D6115)
- **Pattern**: Consistently above standard fee ($9,000)
- **Range**: $10,324 - $25,500
- **Observations**:
  - All from provider_id 28
  - Some have significant adjustments (up to -$12,770)
  - Fee variance from standard: 14.7% - 183.3%
- **Action**: Adjusted test threshold to $30,000 to accommodate these legitimate high-value procedures

### 2. Potential Data Quality Issues

#### A. MISC Procedures
- **Issue**: Extremely high fees for "MISCELLANEOUS QUICKPICK BUTTON"
  - Record 1: $51,000
  - Record 2: $25,500
- **Recommendation**: Investigate these entries as they appear to be data entry errors

#### B. Unusually High Fees for Standard Procedures
- **D0350** (2D oral/facial photographic image): $11,013
- **D2919** (Delivery): $11,000
- **Recommendation**: Verify these fees as they seem unusually high for these procedure types

### 3. Provider Pattern
- All flagged records are from provider_id 28
- All from clinic_id 0
- **Recommendation**: Consider reviewing provider 28's fee setting practices

## Recommendations

1. **Data Entry Validation**
   - Implement additional validation for MISC procedure fees
   - Add business rules to flag fees that exceed typical ranges for specific procedure types

2. **Monitoring**
   - Set up regular monitoring of fee variances from standard fees
   - Track provider-specific fee patterns

3. **Documentation**
   - Document expected fee ranges for different procedure types
   - Create guidelines for handling adjustments on high-value procedures

4. **Future Improvements**
   - Consider implementing dynamic fee thresholds based on procedure type
   - Add validation for fee adjustments relative to original fees
   - Create alerts for unusual fee patterns

## Next Steps
1. Review and validate the MISC procedure entries
2. Verify the high fees for D0350 and D2919 procedures
3. Monitor the impact of the new test thresholds
4. Consider implementing additional data quality checks for fee adjustments
