# Project Pitch: Intelligent Dental Practice Analytics Platform

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

I built a **production-ready data engineering platform** that transforms a complex 432-table dental practice database into actionable business intelligence. Using modern data stack tools (Python ETL, PostgreSQL, dbt), I automated what would normally take weeks of manual setup and delivered **150+ tested analytics models** with 95-99% data quality.

## What is dbt?

**dbt (data build tool)** is a modern analyticsdbt ls -s +fact_claims engineering framework that transforms raw data in your warehouse using SQL. Think of it as **"version control for your analytics"** - it lets you write modular, tested, and documented SQL transformations.

### Why dbt?
- **Modularity**: Break complex queries into reusable components
- **Testing**: Validate data quality automatically  
- **Documentation**: Auto-generate data catalogs with full lineage
- **Version Control**: Track all changes in Git
- **Dependency Management**: Automatically run models in the right order

## The Business Problem

**OpenDental** is a dental practice management system with **432 tables** tracking everything from patient demographics to appointments, procedures, insurance claims, and payments.

### The Challenge
- Data is optimized for operations, **not analytics**
- Normalized across hundreds of tables with complex relationships
- Simple questions like "What's my revenue per provider?" require joining 10+ tables
- Most dental practices rely on Excel + manual queries (slow, error-prone)

### The Opportunity
Turn operational data into strategic insights that drive revenue, improve patient care, and optimize operations.

## My Solution: End-to-End Data Platform

```
OpenDental (MySQL) → ETL Pipeline → PostgreSQL → dbt → Business Intelligence
   432 Tables         Auto-Discovery   Data Warehouse  150+ Models   API + Dashboard
```

### Key Components

#### 1. **Intelligent ETL Pipeline** (Python)
- **Auto-Discovery**: Analyzes all 432 tables in 6 minutes (no manual config)
- **Incremental Loading**: Smart change detection using 60+ timestamp columns
- **Performance**: Processes 17.8M rows with optimized batching (1K-5K rows)
- **Quality**: 95-99% data integrity with automated validation

#### 2. **Analytics Layer** (dbt - 150+ Models)
Transforms operational data through **3 architectural layers**:

**Staging Layer (90+ models)** - Data Foundation
- Standardizes 432 OpenDental tables with custom macros for consistency
- Views for freshness, tables for complex transformations
- Automated metadata tracking on every model (`_loaded_at`, `_created_at`, `_updated_at`)

**Intermediate Layer (50+ models)** - Business Logic
- **Domain-driven design**: Organized into 8 business systems (Fee Processing, Insurance, Payments, AR Analysis, Collections, Communications, Scheduling, Logging)
- Complex business categorization (e.g., mapping 20+ adjustment types to business categories)
- Reusable foundation models (patient profiles, provider profiles)
- All tables with strategic indexing for performance

**Marts Layer (17 models)** - Analytics Ready
- **Star schema**: 7 dimensions + 5 facts + 9 summary marts
- Pre-calculated KPIs (collection rates, completion rates, utilization metrics)
- Business-friendly categorization (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor performance tiers)
- Sub-second query performance through materialization strategy

#### 3. **Business Intelligence Layer**
- **FastAPI Backend**: RESTful API with real-time analytics endpoints
- **React Dashboard**: Executive KPI monitoring with interactive charts
- **Data Quality**: All 150 models passing tests (PASS=150, WARN=0, ERROR=0)

## Key Talking Points

### 1. **Technical Complexity**
"I built an automated system that discovers and processes 432 medical database tables - something that would normally require weeks of manual analysis. The pipeline intelligently detects changes, optimizes performance, and ensures 95-99% data quality."

### 2. **Business Value**
"This transforms operational data into strategic insights. Practices can identify lost revenue, predict patient churn, and optimize operations - capabilities previously only available in expensive commercial solutions."

### 3. **Architectural Design**
"I designed a domain-driven dbt architecture with staging for standardization, intermediate models organized by business systems, and a star schema mart layer. This isn't just SQL—it's 150+ tested models with custom macros, strategic materialization (views → tables → optimized tables), and comprehensive metadata tracking."

### 4. **Production-Ready**
"This isn't a toy project. All 150 dbt models pass comprehensive tests, the pipeline runs daily with monitoring and alerting, and the system is designed for enterprise scale with proper error handling and recovery."

### 5. **Healthcare Domain**
"I developed deep expertise in dental practice workflows - from appointment scheduling to insurance claims processing. The system handles complex clinical and financial data while maintaining HIPAA compliance."

## Questions & Answers

**Q: How is this different from a BI tool like Tableau?**  
A: Tableau visualizes data; I build the data foundation. My ETL and dbt models clean, transform, and prepare the data that BI tools consume. It's the difference between a beautiful dashboard and a beautiful dashboard with accurate, trustworthy data.

**Q: Could this work with other practice management systems?**  
A: Absolutely. The intelligent schema discovery is system-agnostic. I could point it at any database and it would auto-analyze tables, detect relationships, and generate appropriate transformations.

**Q: What's the deployment strategy?**  
A: Currently runs locally with daily manual triggers. Designed for cloud deployment (AWS RDS + EC2) with Airflow orchestration for full automation. I've also built a synthetic data generator for public demos (no real patient data).

**Q: How long did this take?**  
A: ~9 months of iterative development. Started with basic ETL, evolved to intelligent pipeline, then built comprehensive dbt models and frontend. It demonstrates both technical depth and ability to deliver end-to-end solutions.

**Q: What would you improve?**  
A: Three areas: (1) Full Airflow automation for scheduling, (2) Machine learning models for predictive analytics (patient churn, no-show prediction), (3) Multi-tenant architecture to support multiple dental practices.
