### MCP Server Communication Patterns

#### 1. Pre-Processing Validation
```python
# CLI Integration Example
async def run_etl_with_mcp_validation(phase: int):
    # Pre-validation using MCP server
    validation_result = await mcp_client.call_tool(
        "validate_source_data_quality",
        {"phase": phase, "tables": get_phase_tables(phase)}
    )
    
    if not validation_result.passed:
        handle_validation_failures(validation_result.issues)
        return
    
    # Proceed with existing ETL pipeline
    run_standard_etl_pipeline(phase)
```

#### 2. Real-time Model Generation
```python
# Auto-model generation workflow
async def handle_new_table_discovery(table_name: str):
    # Analyze table structure and relationships
    analysis = await mcp_client.call_tool(
        "analyze_table_relationships",
        {"table_name": table_name}
    )
    
    # Generate appropriate dbt models
    models = await mcp_client.call_tool(
        "generate_staging_model",
        {"table_name": table_name, "analysis": analysis}
    )
    
    # Create model files following project conventions
    create_model_files(models)
```

#### 3. Intelligent Scheduling
```python
# Pipeline optimization integration
async def optimize_daily_processing():
    clinic_schedule = get_clinic_schedule()
    current_workload = assess_pipeline_workload()
    
    optimization = await mcp_client.call_tool(
        "optimize_pipeline_schedule",
        {"clinic_schedule": clinic_schedule, "workload": current_workload}
    )
    
    update_processing_schedule(optimization.recommended_schedule)
