# Build-From-Scratch Implementation Plan
## 41 Intermediate Models Across 7 Systems

## Strategic Advantages of Fresh Build

Since these models haven't been deployed yet, we can:
- ✅ **Perfect Consistency**: Every model follows standardized patterns from creation
- ✅ **Optimal Dependencies**: Build in correct dependency order from the start
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Build with performance considerations from day one
- ✅ **Clean Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation from creation
- ✅ **System Integration**: Proper cross-system relationships from the beginning

## Implementation Strategy: Dependency-Driven Development

Based on your system mapping, I've identified the optimal build order that respects dependencies while maximizing parallel development opportunities.

### Phase 0: Foundation and Templates (Week 1)
**Objective**: Create the templates, macros, and foundation that everything else builds on

#### Templates and Standards Creation:
- [ ] **SQL Templates**: Create templates for each model type (Foundation, Transaction, Metrics, etc.)
- [ ] **Documentation Templates**: Create yml templates for each system (A-G)
- [ ] **Macro Library**: Build macros for common patterns (ID transformation, boolean conversion, metadata)
- [ ] **Quality Gates**: Automated checks for naming conventions and standards compliance
- [ ] **System Integration Framework**: Templates showing System A-G integration patterns

#### Foundation Models (Week 1):
**Build Order**: All can be built in parallel as they have no intermediate dependencies

1. **`int_patient_profile`** - Foundation for all patient-related models
2. **`int_provider_profile`** - Foundation for all provider-related models  
3. **`int_opendental_system_logs`** - System audit foundation
4. **`int_ar_analysis`** - Financial foundation (this one is complex, may need most of the week)

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] 4 foundation models fully implemented and documented
- [ ] Template library established and validated
- [ ] Quality gates operational
- [ ] Pattern library documented

### Phase 1: Core Transaction Systems (Weeks 2-4)

3. **`int_adjustments`** - Financial adjustments (complex business logic)

#### Week 3: System C - Payment Processing (3 models)
**Dependencies**: Foundation + System A
**Build Order**: Build in sequence due to internal dependencies

1. **`int_payment_split`** - Payment allocation (depends on fee model and adjustments)
2. **`int_patient_payment_allocated`** - Patient payment tracking
3. **`int_insurance_payment_allocated`** - Insurance payment tracking

#### Week 4: System B - Insurance (7 models)

**Build Order**: Build foundation insurance models first, then dependent ones

**Week 4a** (First half):
1. **`int_insurance_coverage`** - Core insurance coverage
2. **`int_insurance_employer`** - Employer relationships

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **Complex Dependencies**: Build in strict dependency order, validate each step
- **Performance Issues**: Plan for data volumes from the beginning
- **Integration Problems**: Test integrations continuously during development

### Business Risks:
- **Changing Requirements**: Keep business stakeholders engaged throughout
- **Timeline Pressure**: Build quality gates into each week's deliverables
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Document everything as it's built

### Quality Risks:
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Use templates and automated quality checks
- **Documentation Gaps**: Require complete documentation before moving to next model
- **Test Coverage**: Implement comprehensive testing from the beginning

This build-from-scratch approach ensures that every model is built to the same high standards while respecting the complex dependencies between your 7 systems. The result will be a consistent, well-documented, and high-performance set of intermediate models that serve as a strong foundation for your analytics platform.
