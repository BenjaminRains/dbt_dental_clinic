# Naming Conventions Implementation Strategy
## MDC Analytics - ETL Pipeline & dbt Migration Plan

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** June 9th, 2025  
**Status:** Planning Phase  

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic implementation plan for migrating from our current dual-convention 
naming system to the improved, simplified naming conventions documented in `Improved_naming_conventions.md`. 
The implementation will follow a phased approach to minimize risk and ensure system stability.

**Key Decision:** Complete ETL pipeline baseline first, then implement improved conventions for all new development.

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Convention Strengths
- ‚úÖ **Clear distinction** between raw database columns (CamelCase) and derived fields (snake_case)
- ‚úÖ **Working ETL pipeline** with 3.6M+ row extraction capability
- ‚úÖ **Solid type conversion strategies** for PostgreSQL compatibility
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive metadata approach** with proper tracking

### Areas for Improvement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Multiple naming patterns** create cognitive overhead (CamelCase CTEs vs snake_case variables)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **dbt community misalignment** with CamelCase CTE convention
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Tool compatibility issues** with SQL formatters and IDEs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Complex environment variable naming** could be clearer

### Phase 2: Selective High-Impact Migration (Q2 2025)
**Timeline:** 3-6 months after baseline  
**Objective:** Migrate most valuable models first

#### 2.1 Priority Model Identification
**Criteria for Priority:**
- Frequently referenced staging models
- Models with complex CTE structures
- Models used by multiple downstream dependencies
- Models with poor readability due to naming

**Target Models:**
- `stg_opendental__patient` (high dependency)
- `stg_opendental__appointment` (complex CTEs)
- `stg_opendental__treatment` (frequently queried)
- Key fact and dimension tables

#### 2.2 Migration Process
**Steps per model:**
1. **Create parallel model** with new conventions
2. **Validate identical output** using data diff tools
3. **Update downstream dependencies** incrementally
4. **Deprecate old model** after 30-day transition
5. **Remove old model** after validation period

#### 2.3 Environment Variable Updates
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Update to descriptive naming (`OPENDENTAL_SOURCE_*`)
- [ ] Coordinate with deployment pipeline updates
- [ ] Update documentation and configuration management
- [ ] Test all connection functions with new variables

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Top 10 high-impact models migrated successfully
- [ ] Zero data discrepancies between old and new models
- [ ] Improved query readability demonstrated
- [ ] Team adoption of new patterns >80%

### Phase 3: Complete ETL Pipeline Migration (Q3 2025)
**Timeline:** After dbt model migration proven  
**Objective:** Update ETL pipeline to improved conventions

#### 3.1 Python Code Refactoring
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Update connection factory function names
- [ ] Refactor class and variable names for clarity
- [ ] Update tracking table names and schemas
- [ ] Implement new metadata strategy consistently

#### 3.2 Configuration Updates
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Update all environment variable references
- [ ] Refactor database connection logic
- [ ] Update logging and monitoring to new conventions
- [ ] Update CLI command naming and help text

#### 3.3 Performance Validation
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Benchmark performance vs. baseline
- [ ] Validate extraction/load times unchanged
- [ ] Test edge cases and error handling
- [ ] Update monitoring dashboards

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] ETL pipeline performance maintained or improved
- [ ] Zero functional regressions
- [ ] All tracking and logging uses new conventions
- [ ] Documentation fully updated
