    description: >
      Complete tracking history for insurance claims, preserving all status updates and notes.
      Each record represents a tracking entry for a claim, showing its progression through the insurance process.
      
      Key features:
      - Tracks all status changes and updates for insurance claims
      - Preserves detailed tracking notes and timestamps
      - Links to int_claim_details for validation
      - Maintains chronological history of claim progression
      
      Data Sources:
      - stg_opendental__claimtracking: Base tracking information (PRIMARY SOURCE)
      - int_claim_details: Validation against claim details
      
      Metadata Strategy:
      - Primary source: claimtracking (stg_opendental__claimtracking) - contains core tracking details and business timestamps
      - Preserves business timestamps from primary source for audit trail (_created_at only, no _updated_at or _created_by available)
      - Maintains pipeline tracking with _loaded_at and _transformed_at for debugging
      - Uses standardize_intermediate_metadata macro for consistency
