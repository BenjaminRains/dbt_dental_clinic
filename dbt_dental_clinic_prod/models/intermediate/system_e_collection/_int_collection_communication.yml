      Intermediate model for collection communications.
      Tracks all communications related to collection efforts.
      Part of System E: Collections
      
      Key features:
      - Tracks all collection-related communications (calls, emails, letters, texts)
      - Links communications to specific collection campaigns and tasks
      - Records both outbound and inbound communication flows
      - Tracks patient responses and promised payments
      - Monitors communication outcomes and effectiveness
      - Manages follow-up requirements and scheduling
      - Integrates with payment tracking and collection tasks
      - Provides communication history for patient accounts
      
      Data Sources:
      - stg_opendental__commlog: Base communication log data (primary source for metadata)
      - stg_opendental__patient: Patient information
      - stg_opendental__payment: Payment tracking
      - int_collection_campaigns: Collection campaign details
      - int_collection_tasks: Collection task information
      
      Metadata Strategy:
      - Preserves business timestamps from stg_opendental__commlog as primary source
      - Uses standardized metadata fields (_loaded_at, _transformed_at, _created_at, _updated_at, _created_by)
      - Maintains data lineage for pipeline debugging and monitoring
      
      Business rules:
      - Communications are linked to campaigns and tasks when applicable
      - Tracks both successful and unsuccessful communication attempts
      - Records promised payments and compares with actual payments
      - Follow-up requirements are determined by communication outcome
      - Communication effectiveness is measured by payment results
      - Templates are used for standardized communication
      - Patient responses are categorized and tracked
