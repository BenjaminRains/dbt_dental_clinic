      Intermediate model for statement metrics.
      Provides aggregated metrics on statement effectiveness for collections.
      Part of System E: Collections
      
      Key features:
      - Tracks statement effectiveness metrics at multiple levels (overall, delivery method, campaign)
      - Calculates collection statement ratios and payment response rates
      - Measures payment response timing (7, 14, 30 day windows)
      - Tracks full vs partial payment outcomes
      - Monitors collection balance recovery rates
      - Provides snapshot-based historical performance tracking
      - Integrates with collection campaigns and delivery methods
      - Calculates early payment response ratios
      - Preserves business timestamps and data lineage from primary source
      - Maintains pipeline monitoring capabilities with _loaded_at and _transformed_at
      
      Data Sources:
      - int_billing_statements: Base statement data and payment tracking
      - int_collection_campaigns: Campaign performance context
      - int_ar_analysis: Patient AR balances and aging information
      - stg_opendental__payment: Payment tracking and fulfillment
      
      Business rules:
      - Metrics are calculated at overall, delivery method, and campaign levels
      - Collection statement ratio = collection_statements / total_statements
      - Statement payment rate = statements_with_payment / total_statements
      - Collection payment rate = statements_with_payment / collection_statements
      - Balance collection rate = payment_amount_30days / total_balance
      - Full payment is defined as 90% or more of statement balance
      - Early response ratio = payment_amount_7days / payment_amount_30days
      - Collection statements are identified by aging and campaign association
