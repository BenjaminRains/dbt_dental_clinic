      Intermediate model for collection metrics.
      Tracks performance metrics for collection efforts.
      Part of System E: Collections
      
      Key features:
      - Provides comprehensive collection performance metrics at multiple levels
      - Tracks metrics at overall, campaign, and individual user levels
      - Calculates collection rates and contact effectiveness
      - Monitors payment promise fulfillment and punctuality
      - Measures communication efficiency and task completion
      - Tracks average days to payment and contacts per payment
      - Provides snapshot-based historical performance tracking
      - Integrates with campaigns, tasks, and communications
      
      Data Sources:
      - int_collection_campaigns: Campaign performance data (primary source for metadata)
      - int_collection_tasks: Task completion metrics
      - int_collection_communication: Communication effectiveness
      - stg_opendental__payment: Payment tracking and fulfillment
      - stg_opendental__patient: Account and AR information
      
      Metadata Strategy:
      - Preserves business timestamps from int_collection_campaigns as primary source
      - Uses standardized metadata fields (_loaded_at, _transformed_at, _created_at, _updated_at, _created_by)
      - Maintains data lineage for pipeline debugging and monitoring
      
      Business rules:
      - Metrics are calculated at overall, campaign, and user levels
      - Collection rate = collected_amount / total_ar_amount
      - Contact rate = accounts_contacted / total_accounts
      - Payment fulfillment rate = actual_payments / promised_payments
      - Payment punctuality is measured against promised dates
      - Communication efficiency is tracked through contacts per payment
      - Task completion rates are monitored for process effectiveness
      - Historical snapshots are maintained for trend analysis
