          Outcome of statement (full_payment, partial_payment, no_payment)
          
          Business Logic:
          - no_payment: When payment_amount_30days = 0 (regardless of balance)
          - partial_payment: When payment_amount_30days > 0 but < 90% of positive balance, or for negative/zero balances with payments
          - full_payment: When payment_amount_30days >= 90% of positive balance
          
          Edge Cases:
          - Zero balance statements with no payments: Always 'no_payment'
          - Negative balance statements: Always 'partial_payment' if payments exist, 'no_payment' if no payments
          - Zero balance statements with payments: Always 'partial_payment'
          
          Note: Payment amount inconsistencies (7-day > 14-day > 30-day) may occur due to payment processing timing and are considered legitimate edge cases.
