      Intermediate model for collection campaigns. 
      Tracks organized collection efforts targeting specific patient groups.
      Part of System E: Collections
      
      Key features:
      - Manages targeted collection campaigns for specific patient segments
      - Tracks campaign performance metrics and collection rates
      - Supports aging-based and balance-based targeting criteria
      - Monitors campaign progress through status tracking
      - Calculates collection effectiveness metrics
      - Designed to work with AR analysis data
      - Provides aging bucket context for targeted accounts
      
      Data Sources:
      - int_ar_analysis: Patient AR balances and aging (primary source for metadata)
      
      Metadata Strategy:
      - Preserves business timestamps from int_ar_analysis as primary source
      - Uses standardized metadata fields (_loaded_at, _transformed_at, _created_at, _updated_at, _created_by)
      - Maintains data lineage for pipeline debugging and monitoring
      
      Business rules:
      - Campaigns target accounts based on aging and balance thresholds
      - Collection rate is calculated as collected_amount / total_ar_amount
      - Campaign status transitions through planned, active, completed, or canceled
      - Priority levels help manage multiple concurrent campaigns
      - Campaign effectiveness is tracked through collection metrics
      - Campaign metrics are calculated based on AR analysis data
