      - Links tasks to specific collection campaigns
      - Monitors task status and completion rates
      - Tracks payment promises and actual payments
      - Enables follow-up task management
      - Provides aging context for each task
      - Categorizes tasks by type (call, email, letter, etc.)
      - Tracks task priority and assignment
      - Integrates with AR analysis for financial context
      - Supports collection workflow management
      - Identifies collection tasks through multiple criteria (keywords, task lists)
      - Tracks historical collection activities
      
      Data Sources:
      - stg_opendental__task: Primary task data
      - int_collection_campaigns: Collection campaign details
      - int_ar_analysis: Patient AR balances and aging information
      
      Business rules:
      - Tasks are linked to campaigns based on description matching or campaign name
      - Task types are determined by description keywords (call, email, letter, text)
      - Collection tasks are identified through:
        - Direct keywords (collect, payment, balance, due, owe, pay, bill, account, write off)
        - Task list membership (collection-related task lists)
        - Campaign association
      - Task status is mapped from numeric codes to descriptive values (pending, in_progress, completed)
      - Priority levels are mapped from numeric codes to descriptive values (high, medium, low)
      - Aging buckets are determined from AR analysis data (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+ days)
      - Follow-up tasks are tracked and linked to original tasks
      - All historical collection tasks are included (no date restrictions)
      - Tasks are categorized by communication method for tracking effectiveness
