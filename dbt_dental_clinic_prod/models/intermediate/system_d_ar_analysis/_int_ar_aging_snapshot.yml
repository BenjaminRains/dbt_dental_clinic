    description: >
      AR aging snapshot model that tracks changes in accounts receivable balances
      over time and calculates collection efficiency metrics. This model provides
      historical context for AR analysis and helps monitor collection performance.
      
      Key features:
      - Creates daily snapshots of AR aging buckets
      - Tracks changes in balances over time
      - Calculates collection efficiency metrics
      - Monitors insurance vs patient responsibility
      - Tracks open procedures and active claims
      - Preserves source tracking information
      
      Data Sources:
      - int_ar_balance: Current AR balances and aging information
      - int_ar_shared_calculations: Payment activity for collection efficiency
      - self: Previous day's snapshot for change tracking
      
      Business rules:
      - Snapshots are created daily
      - Balances are grouped by aging buckets (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+ days)
      - Collection efficiency is calculated over 30, 60, and 90 day periods
      - Changes are calculated against previous day's snapshot
      - Insurance and patient responsibility are tracked separately
      - Source tracking information is preserved from int_ar_balance
      - Balances older than 18 months are considered unenforceable and should be written off
      - Historical data beyond 18 months is retained for analysis but marked as warnings

          beyond 18 months is retained for analysis but marked as warnings.

                  for potential write-off actions.
