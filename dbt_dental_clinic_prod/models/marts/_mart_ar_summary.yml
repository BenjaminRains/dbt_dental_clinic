      Summary mart for comprehensive accounts receivable analysis and collection management.
      This mart provides aggregated AR metrics, aging analysis, and collection performance
      tracking to support financial management, collection prioritization, and payment
      workflow optimization at patient-provider level by date.
      
      Part of System A: Financial Management workflow.
      
      Grain: One row per date + patient + provider combination (composite key: date_id, patient_id, provider_id)
      
      Key Features:
      - AR aging analysis: Comprehensive aging buckets (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+ days) with percentage calculations
      - Collection rate tracking: Overall, patient, and insurance collection rate calculations and performance metrics
      - Risk categorization: Automated risk assessment based on aging patterns and payment history
      - Collection prioritization: Priority scoring system (0-100 scale) for workflow optimization
      - Payment activity analysis: Recent payment tracking and recency categorization
      
      Data Sources:
      - dim_patient: Patient balance information, demographic data, and insurance status
      - fact_claim: Insurance billing data, payment amounts, and claim activity
      - fact_payment: Payment transaction details and payment type classifications
      - dim_provider: Provider information and specialty details
      - dim_date: Date dimension for temporal analysis and reporting
      
      Aggregation Logic Features:
      - AR aging calculations: Percentage distribution of balances across aging buckets
      - Collection rate formulas: Payment amounts divided by billed amounts with null handling
      - Risk scoring algorithm: Multi-factor scoring based on balance size, aging, payment recency, and insurance status
      - Activity aggregation: 365-day rolling window for recent activity calculations
      
      Business Metrics:
      - AR aging percentages: Distribution of outstanding balances by time buckets
      - Collection rates: Overall, patient, and insurance payment collection performance
      - Risk categories: High, Medium, Moderate, Low risk classifications for collection prioritization
      - Priority scores: 0-100 scale for collection workflow optimization
      - Payment recency: Recent, Moderate, Old, Very Old activity classifications
      
      Data Quality Notes:
      - Payment plan functionality not used by clinic: All payment plan fields set to default values (0)
      - Balance estimates: Balances may include estimates and pending insurance amounts requiring validation
      - Historical data limitation: Recent activity calculations limited to 365 days for performance optimization
      - Credit balance handling: Negative balances properly categorized as 'Credit Balance' risk category
      
      Business Rules:
      - Aging risk categorization: Based on percentage of balance over 90 days with tiered thresholds
      - Collection priority scoring: Multi-factor algorithm considering balance size, aging, payment recency, and insurance status
      - Patient responsibility calculation: Total balance minus insurance estimate, minimum zero
      - Activity recency classification: 30/90/180 day thresholds for payment and claim activity categorization
      - Balance categorization: Tiered balance size categories for operational reporting and analysis
