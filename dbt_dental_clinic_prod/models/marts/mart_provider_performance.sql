Summary Mart model for Provider Performance
Part of System G: Scheduling and Performance Management

This model:
1. Provides comprehensive provider performance analytics and tracking
2. Supports practice management and provider development decisions
3. Enables comparative performance analysis across providers and specialties
4. Tracks key performance indicators for operational optimization

Business Logic Features:
- Production and collection performance metrics with efficiency calculations
- Appointment scheduling and completion rate analysis
- Patient volume and demographic analysis
- Financial performance tracking with insurance acceptance rates
- Time utilization and productivity indicators
- Comparative ranking within specialties and overall practice

Key Metrics:
- Production Metrics: Total production, collections, production per hour, collection efficiency
- Appointment Performance: Completion rates, no-show rates, scheduling efficiency
- Patient Metrics: Daily unique patients, new patient rates, demographic analysis
- Financial Performance: Claims processing, insurance acceptance, billing efficiency
- Time Management: Productive hours, utilization categories, efficiency indicators

Data Quality Notes:
- Handles null values in division operations with nullif() functions
- Aggregates data across multiple clinics for provider-level analysis
- Uses window functions for comparative rankings
- Preserves data lineage from upstream mart models

Performance Considerations:
- Optimized with composite indexes on date_id and provider_id
- Uses efficient joins with proper foreign key relationships
- Implements window functions for ranking calculations
- Aggregates complex metrics in separate CTEs for clarity

Dependencies:
- mart_production_summary: Core production and scheduling data
- mart_appt_summary: Appointment efficiency and timing metrics
- fact_claim: Claims and billing performance data
- fact_appointment: Patient relationship and demographic data
- dim_date: Date dimension for temporal analysis
- dim_provider: Provider master data and attributes
- dim_procedure: Procedure classification and complexity flags
- dim_patient: Patient demographic and complexity indicators
