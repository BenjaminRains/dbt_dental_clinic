      Fact table containing individual claim transactions and procedures.
      This model serves as the foundation for claim-level analysis and reporting,
      providing detailed information about each claim procedure and its associated
      payments, statuses, and documentation.

      ## Business Context
      The claim fact table is a critical component of our dimensional model, enabling:
      - Individual claim transaction analysis
      - Procedure-level payment tracking
      - Claim status monitoring
      - EOB documentation tracking
      - Payment timing analysis
      - Revenue cycle metrics

      ## Technical Specifications
      - Grain: One row per claim procedure (claim_id + procedure_id + claim_procedure_id)
      - Source: int_claim_details (primary source)
      - Refresh: Daily
      - Dependencies: 
        * int_claim_details (core claim data)
        * int_claim_payments (payment information)
        * int_claim_snapshot (historical states)
        * int_claim_tracking (status updates)
        * int_insurance_eob_attachments (EOB documentation)

      ## Business Logic
      ### Claim Processing
      - Claims are tracked at the procedure level
      - Multiple procedures can be part of one claim
      - Each procedure can have multiple payments
      - EOB attachments are linked to payments

      ### Payment Handling
      - Payments can be partial or complete
      - Multiple payment types supported
      - Write-offs and patient responsibility tracked
      - Payment timing recorded

      ### Status Tracking
      - Claim status at procedure level
      - Payment status tracking
      - EOB documentation status
      - Verification status

      ## Data Quality Notes
      - Claims are deduplicated using composite key
      - Payment amounts are validated
      - Status transitions are tracked
      - EOB attachments are verified

      ## Usage Guidelines
      - Primary source for claim-level analysis
      - Supports daily, monthly, and rolling period aggregations
      - Enables breakdowns by provider, location, and patient type
      - Integrates with dim_insurance for plan-level analysis
      - Supports procedure-level analysis
      - Enables payment performance analysis
      - Facilitates EOB documentation tracking

      ## Dimensional Relationships
      - Links to dim_insurance through insurance_plan_id
      - Links to dim_patient through patient_id
      - Links to dim_procedure through procedure_id
      - Links to dim_provider through provider_id
      - Links to dim_date through claim_date

      ## Naming Conventions
      - Source columns from OpenDental use original CamelCase names
      - Derived/calculated fields use snake_case
      - Metadata columns use underscore prefix (_loaded_at, _created_at, _updated_at)
      - Amount fields use descriptive suffixes (_amount)
      - Status fields use descriptive prefixes (is_, has_)
