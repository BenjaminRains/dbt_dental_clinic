  - name: dim_date
    description: >
      Date dimension table providing comprehensive time intelligence and calendar attributes.
      This model serves as the foundation for all time-based analysis in the dental practice,
      supporting both operational and financial reporting needs.

      ## Business Context
      The date dimension is a critical component of our dimensional model, enabling:
      - Time-based analysis across all business processes
      - Fiscal period alignment for financial reporting
      - Business day calculations for operational metrics
      - Holiday-adjusted performance analysis
      - Rolling period comparisons

      ## Technical Specifications
      - Grain: One row per calendar day
      - Date Range: 2020-01-01 through 2030-12-31
      - Refresh: Daily (static data, no incremental processing needed)
      - Dependencies: None (self-contained date generation)

      ## Business Logic
      ### Calendar Attributes
      - Standard calendar year, quarter, month, and day attributes
      - Day of week (0-6, where 0 is Sunday, 6 is Saturday)
      - Month and day names for reporting

      ### Fiscal Periods
      - Fiscal year starts in October (Q1: Oct-Dec)
      - Fiscal quarters aligned with business planning cycles
      - Fiscal year calculation: Current year + 1 if month >= 10

      ### Business Days
      - Weekdays (Monday-Friday) excluding holidays
      - Sequential business day numbering within each month
      - Holiday calendar includes major US federal holidays
      - Business day flags for operational metrics

      ### Time Intelligence
      - Rolling 12-month window for trend analysis
      - Prior year period comparison support
      - Holiday-adjusted performance indicators
      - Weekend vs. weekday differentiation

      ## Usage Guidelines
      ### Common Time Periods
      - Current Month: WHERE is_rolling_12_months = true
      - Prior Year: WHERE is_same_period_prior_year = true
      - Business Days: WHERE is_business_day = true
      - Fiscal Periods: GROUP BY fiscal_year, fiscal_quarter

      ### Performance Considerations
      - Pre-calculated flags minimize runtime calculations
      - Indexed on date_id for optimal join performance
      - Static nature allows for materialized views

      ### Common Joins
      - Fact tables: ON fact.date_id = dim_date.date_id
      - Appointment tables: ON apt.appointment_date = dim_date.date_day
      - Financial tables: ON fin.transaction_date = dim_date.date_day
