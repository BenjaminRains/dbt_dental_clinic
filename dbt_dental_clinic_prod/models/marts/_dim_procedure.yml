    description: >
      Procedure dimension table providing comprehensive dental procedure attributes and categorizations.
      This model serves as the foundation for procedure-based analysis in the dental practice,
      supporting clinical, operational, and financial reporting needs.

      ## Business Context
      The procedure dimension is a critical component of our dimensional model, enabling:
      - Procedure-based analysis across all business processes
      - Clinical categorization and complexity assessment
      - Revenue tier analysis and financial planning
      - Treatment planning and scheduling optimization
      - Insurance billing and claim processing
      - Fee schedule management and standard fee analysis

      ## Technical Specifications
      - Grain: One row per unique procedure code
      - Source: stg_opendental__procedurecode
      - Refresh: Incremental (based on source updates)
      - Dependencies: 
        * stg_opendental__feesched
        * stg_opendental__fee
        * stg_opendental__definition

      ## Business Logic
      ### Procedure Categories
      - Based on CDT code prefixes (D1-D8)
      - Enhanced with clinical flags (hygiene, prosthetic, radiology)
      - Supports both standard and custom procedure types

      ### Complexity Levels
      - Simple: Single visit, low base units
      - Moderate: Multiple visits or medium base units
      - Complex: Multi-visit procedures or high base units

      ### Revenue Tiers
      - High: Major procedures (prosthodontics, surgery, orthodontics)
      - Medium: Specialty procedures (endodontics, periodontics)
      - Low: Basic procedures (preventive, restorative, diagnostic)

      ### Clinical Attributes
      - Treatment area specifications
      - Base unit calculations
      - Default provider assignments
      - Documentation requirements

      ### Fee Schedule Management
      - Standard fee tracking per procedure
      - Fee schedule type categorization
      - Fee statistics and validation
      - Historical fee tracking
