    description: >
      Staging model for task records from OpenDental. Contains information about tasks, reminders, and to-do items
      associated with patients, procedures, and other entities in the system.
      
      Business Context:
      - Supports task management and reminders across the practice
      - Links tasks to various entities (patients, procedures, etc.)
      - Tracks task assignments, priorities, and completion status
      - Handles both one-time and repeating tasks
      - Supports different reminder types and frequencies
      
      Data Scope:
      - Records from 2023-01-01 onwards
      - Includes all task types and statuses
      - Captures both active and completed tasks
      
      Key Relationships:
      - Links to task lists through task_list_id
      - Links to users through user_id (assignee)
      - Links to various entities through key_id (based on object_type)
      - Links to task creators through from_id
      - Links to priority definitions through priority_def_id
      - Links to triage categories through triage_category_id
      
      Important Business Rules:
      - Tasks must have a valid task_date
      - Task status must be valid
      - Object type determines the entity type for key_id
      - Repeating tasks have specific frequency patterns
      - Read-only tasks cannot be modified

      usage_notes: >
        - Use task_date for scheduling and timeline analysis
        - Check triage_category_id for task prioritization
        - Be aware that tasks with date_type = 0 may legitimately have null task_date and triage_category_id
        - Some tasks may reference non-existent task lists
        - Task notes from before 2023-01-01 are not included
        - Future dates (2025) may indicate data entry issues
