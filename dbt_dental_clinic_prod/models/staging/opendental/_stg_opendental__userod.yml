    description: >
      Staging model for user/operator data from OpenDental. Contains comprehensive
      information about system users, including their authentication details, security
      settings, and relationships to other entities like employees and providers.
      
      This model serves as the foundation for user management and access control in the
      dental practice system. It tracks user authentication, security settings, and
      relationships to other key entities like employees, providers, and clinics.

            Approximately 21 records have invalid user_group_id references. Common reasons:
            - Historical user groups that have been deleted
            - System users with special group assignments

            Approximately 49 records have invalid employee_id references. Common reasons:

            Approximately 44 users are referenced in commlog but not in the excluded list. Common reasons:

            - Staff members who create commlog entries
            - Historical users who created commlog entries
            - System users who generate automated communications

        - Use this model to understand user access and authentication
        - Join with stg_opendental__usergroup for group assignments
        - Join with stg_opendental__employee for employee details
        - Join with stg_opendental__provider for provider details
        - Note that creation and update timestamps are not available in source
        - All timestamps are in UTC
        - Contains sensitive security information - handle with appropriate security measures
