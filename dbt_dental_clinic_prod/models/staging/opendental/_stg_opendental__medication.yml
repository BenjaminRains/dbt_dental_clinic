    description: >
      Staging model for medications from OpenDental. Contains information about medications, including 
      their names, generic equivalents, and RxNorm codes for clinical and pharmacy integration.
      
      This model serves as the foundation for medication tracking across clinical workflows,
      prescription management, and allergy checking. Each record represents a unique medication
      that can be prescribed or referenced in treatment plans.
      
      Note: This table excludes medication_id = 0, which is reserved in allergydef 
      for non-medication allergies (environmental allergens, materials, drug classes like latex, 
      acrylic, food allergies, etc.).

      usage_notes: >
        Use this model for medication lookups, prescription validation, and allergy checking.
        When joining with patient allergies, exclude medication_id = 0 as this represents
        non-medication allergens. For generic substitution analysis, use the generic_id
        relationships to identify equivalent medications.

        description: >
          Primary key - Unique identifier for the medication in OpenDental 
          (maps to MedicationNum in OpenDental). Used throughout the system 
          for medication references, prescriptions, and allergy tracking.

          - not_null

      - name: generic_id
        description: >
          Foreign key to the generic medication - References another medication record 
          that represents the generic equivalent of this medication. For brand name 
          medications, this may point to the generic version. For generic medications, 
          this typically points to itself. Used for generic substitution logic.

        description: >
          Name of the medication as displayed in OpenDental. This is the primary

          This field is optional and may contain clinical guidance or system notes.

      - name: rxcui
        description: >
          RxNorm Concept Unique Identifier (RxCUI) for the medication. This standardized
          code enables integration with pharmacy systems, drug databases, and clinical
          decision support systems. Required for electronic prescribing and drug
          interaction checking.

        description: >
          Timestamp when the medication record was last updated in OpenDental
