    description: >
      Staging model for OpenDental program configurations and integrated software settings. 
      Contains configuration information for external programs, plugins, and tools that integrate 
      with the OpenDental practice management system.
      
      This reference table defines the programs available for integration and their settings, 
      including executable paths, command line parameters, and UI configurations. These programs 
      are referenced in communication logs and other system activities to track which external 
      systems are used for various operations.
      
      Note: This table contains only actual program configurations. The communication system 
      (commlog table) uses additional program_id values that are not stored here:
      - program_id = 0: System default communications (no specific program)
      - program_id = 95: Legacy communication system references
      
      These special IDs represent internal system communications rather than external program integrations.

      usage_notes: >
        Use this model to understand available program integrations and their configurations.
        When analyzing communication patterns, join with stg_opendental__commlog using program_id,
        but be aware that many communications use special program_ids (0, 95) not found in this table.
        For program availability analysis, check both is_enabled and is_disabled_by_hq flags.
        File paths and command line parameters may contain sensitive system information.
