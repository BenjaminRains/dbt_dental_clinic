    description: >
      Staging model for task notes from OpenDental. Contains detailed notes and comments associated with tasks, including user attribution and timestamps.
      
      Business Context:
      - Task notes provide detailed documentation of task-related activities
      - Notes can be added by any user with task access
      - Notes are timestamped and user-attributed for audit purposes
      - Notes may reference task status changes, completions, or cancellations
      - Notes are preserved even if the associated task is removed
      
      Data Scope:
      - Records from 2020-11-01 onwards
      - Includes all note types and lengths
      - Captures both active and orphaned notes
      
      Key Relationships:
      - Links to tasks through task_id
      - Links to users through user_id
      
      Important Business Rules:
      - Notes must have a valid user_id
      - Notes must have a valid note_datetime
      - Notes can exist without an associated task (orphaned notes)
      - Orphaned notes are primarily from 2020-2022
      - Most orphaned notes are routine task updates
      - Orphaned notes are not typically related to task deletion

        - rule: "Most orphaned notes are routine task updates"
          impact: "Suggests legitimate notes that lost task reference"

          impact: "Indicates potential data migration or system issue"
      
      usage_notes: >
        - Use user_id to track who created each note
        - Check note_datetime for chronological analysis
        - Be aware of the task relationship warning when joining to tasks
        - Orphaned notes are primarily historical (2020-2022)
        - Most orphaned notes appear to be legitimate task updates
        - Note lengths vary significantly (2-484 characters)
        - Multiple users involved in creating orphaned notes
        - Peak activity in early 2021, declining trend over time
