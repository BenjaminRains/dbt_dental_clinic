        - Use rx_date for temporal analysis
        - Check send_status for prescription transmission status
        - is_controlled flag is critical for controlled substance reporting
        - erx_guid is required for electronic prescriptions
        - DaysOfSupply field is not currently used in the system
        - Refills field contains data quality issues (999 and empty string values)
        - Clinic relationship test is currently disabled; will be implemented when staging model is available
