    description: >
      Staging model for dental documents including images, files, and attachments associated with patient records.
      
      This model contains comprehensive information about various documents stored in the OpenDental system,
      including clinical images, scanned documents, digital signatures, and other file attachments. Documents
      can be linked to specific patients, procedures, or mount items. The model includes both document metadata
      and binary content (Base64 encoded) along with image processing parameters like rotation, cropping, and
      windowing settings for proper display and manipulation.

      business_rules:
        - rule: "Provider ID of 0 in source system represents system-generated documents"
          impact: "Converted to NULL in staging for proper foreign key relationships"
        - rule: "Document categories link to definition table for standardized categorization"
          impact: "Essential for document classification and filtering in downstream models"
        - rule: "Mount items provide grouping for related images (like X-ray series)"
          impact: "Critical for clinical workflow organization and image management"
        - rule: "Document processing workflow allows creation date to be after timestamp date"
          impact: "date_timestamp = when processing started, date_created = when finalized. Common for insurance documents and system-generated files that require approval workflows. Differences typically range from hours to days, with rare cases up to weeks for complex processing."
      
      usage_notes: >
        Key considerations for analysts:
        - Raw Base64 and Thumbnail columns contain large binary data - avoid selecting unless necessary
        - Image processing parameters (crop, rotation, windowing) are used by OpenDental client for display
        - Tooth numbers are stored as comma-separated strings and may need parsing for analysis
        - Document dates represent creation and last modification in OpenDental, not file system dates
        - OCR response data is only available for recent documents with text extraction capabilities
