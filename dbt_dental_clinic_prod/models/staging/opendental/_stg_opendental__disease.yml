    description: >
      Staging model for OpenDental disease records containing patient disease history and health conditions.
      
      This model captures disease/condition records from the OpenDental practice management system, including 
      diagnosis dates, resolution dates, clinical status, and associated notes. Each record represents a 
      disease or health condition diagnosed for a specific patient, with SNOMED CT classification support
      for standardized medical coding. The model includes both active and resolved conditions, making it
      essential for comprehensive patient health history analysis and care continuity tracking.

      usage_notes: >
        This model is essential for clinical analysis, patient health history tracking, and care continuity.
        When analyzing active conditions, filter for records where date_stop IS NULL. For historical 
        analysis, include all records regardless of date_stop status. The model supports both clinical
        workflows and administrative reporting. SNOMED codes enable integration with external medical
        systems and regulatory reporting requirements.

          Primary key - Unique identifier for each disease/condition record in the OpenDental system
          (maps to DiseaseNum in OpenDental). This ID is used to track individual disease records
          and link to related clinical documentation and treatment plans.

        description: >
          Foreign key to the patient table - Links the disease record to the specific patient
          (maps to PatNum in OpenDental). Essential for patient health history aggregation
          and clinical care coordination.

          Foreign key to the disease definition table - References the standardized disease/condition
          definition (maps to DiseaseDefNum in OpenDental). Links to disease catalogs and medical
          coding systems for consistent diagnosis classification.
        tests:
