      Staging model for communication logs from OpenDental system, capturing all patient communications 
      including appointments, clinical notes, billing notifications, and system-generated messages.
      
      This model contains comprehensive communication history tracking all interactions between the practice 
      and patients across multiple channels (email, SMS, phone, in-person, letters). Records span from 
      2023-01-01 onwards and include both automated system communications and manual practice communications.
      The data supports communication audit trails, patient engagement analysis, and appointment workflow tracking.

      usage_notes: >
        Use this model for communication audit trails, patient engagement analysis, and appointment workflow tracking.
        When analyzing user performance, exclude system-generated communications (user_id = 0).
        For appointment-related communications, focus on types 224 (primary notifications) and 228 (secondary notifications).
        Communication source field may be null for 42.23% of records (types 224 and 228) which is expected behavior.
