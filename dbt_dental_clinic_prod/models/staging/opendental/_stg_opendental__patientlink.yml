      Standardized patient link records from OpenDental, tracking relationships and merges between patient records.
      
      This table captures the linkage information between patients, typically used for:
      - Patient record merging when duplicate records are identified
      - Family relationships and household connections
      - Data consolidation and patient history tracking
      
      Each record represents a directional link from one patient to another, with the link type indicating
      the nature of the relationship. This is critical for maintaining data integrity when patient records
      are merged or when tracking family units for billing and treatment planning.

      usage_notes: >
        Use this table to understand patient merge history and maintain data integrity when analyzing
        patient-related metrics. Always consider linked patients when calculating unique patient counts
        or patient visit histories. The linked_at timestamp indicates when the link was established,
        which is important for historical analysis.

    columns:
      - name: patient_link_id
        description: >
          Primary key - Unique identifier for each patient link record (maps to PatientLinkNum in OpenDental).
          
          This is the system-generated unique identifier that tracks each individual link relationship
          between patients in the system.
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
          - positive_values
      
      - name: patient_id_from
        description: >
          Foreign key to stg_opendental__patient - Source patient identifier in the link relationship.
          
          This represents the patient record that is being linked FROM (typically the record that becomes
          inactive in a merge scenario). References the patient_id in the patient table.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - relationships:
              to: ref('stg_opendental__patient')
              field: patient_id
              severity: error
      
      - name: patient_id_to
        description: >
          Foreign key to stg_opendental__patient - Destination patient identifier in the link relationship.
          
          This represents the patient record that is being linked TO (typically the active record that
          remains after a merge). References the patient_id in the patient table.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - relationships:
              to: ref('stg_opendental__patient')
              field: patient_id
              severity: error
      
      - name: link_type
        description: >
          Type of relationship between the linked patients. Common values include:
          0 = Merge (most common - indicates patient records were merged)
          1 = Family (indicates family relationship)
          2 = Household (indicates same household/billing unit)
          
          This field is critical for understanding the nature of the patient relationship and
          how to handle the linked records in analysis.
        tests:
          - not_null:
              name: "not_null_link_type"
              severity: warn
          - accepted_values:
              values: [0, 1, 2]
              severity: warn
      
      - name: linked_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the patient link was established (maps to DateTimeLink in OpenDental).
          
          This represents when the link relationship was created in the system, which is important
          for understanding the timing of patient merges and maintaining historical accuracy.
          Stored in system timezone (typically practice local time).
        tests:
          - not_null
      
      - name: _loaded_at
        description: "Timestamp when the data was loaded into the data warehouse by the ETL pipeline (using current_timestamp)"
        tests:
          - not_null
      
      - name: _created_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the patient link record was created in the source system (OpenDental). 
          Maps to DateTimeLink column. This represents the original creation time of the link
          relationship in the practice management system.
        tests:
          - not_null
      
      - name: _updated_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the patient link record was last updated in the source system (OpenDental). 
          Maps to DateTimeLink column. Since patient links are typically created once and not modified,
          this often matches _created_at.
        tests:
          - not_null
      
      - name: _created_by_user_id
        description: >
          User who created the patient link record in the source system (OpenDental). 
          This field is null for patient link records as OpenDental does not track the creating user
          for this table type.
        tests:
          - relationships:
              to: ref('stg_opendental__user')
              field: user_id
              severity: warn
              where: "_created_by_user_id is not null"
