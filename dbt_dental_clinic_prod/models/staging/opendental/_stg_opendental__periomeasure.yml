    description: >
      Staging model for periodontal measurements from OpenDental. Contains detailed measurements 
      for teeth examined during periodontal exams, capturing pocket depths and other periodontal 
      health indicators at multiple positions around each tooth.
      
      This model focuses on recent data (2023 onwards) and joins with perioexam records to ensure 
      only valid examinations are included. Each record represents a specific measurement for a 
      tooth position during a periodontal examination, enabling detailed analysis of periodontal 
      health trends and treatment outcomes.

      usage_notes: >
        Key considerations when using this model:
        - Data scope is limited to 2023+ for performance and relevance
        - Multiple measurements per tooth position may exist if re-examinations occurred
        - Measurement positions follow dental terminology (mesial=toward midline, distal=away from midline, buccal=cheek side, lingual=tongue side)
        - Zero values may indicate no measurement taken rather than 0mm depth
        - Compare with perioexam model for examination context and provider information
