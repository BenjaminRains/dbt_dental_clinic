    description: >
      Staging model for appointment types from OpenDental system.
      Contains information about different types of appointments, their display properties,
      and associated metadata used for scheduling and appointment categorization.
      
      This model includes both active appointment types visible to users and hidden/legacy 
      types maintained for historical data integrity. The 'None' type (appointment_type_id = 0)
      represents a valid, selectable option for appointments that haven't had specific details 
      appended yet.

      usage_notes: >
        When analyzing appointment data:
        - Filter to is_hidden = 0 for current appointment type options
        - Include appointment_type_id = 0 ('None') as valid appointment data
        - Use item_order for consistent UI display sequencing
        - Pattern and code strings define appointment duration and associated procedures
        - Consider that some appointment types may have specific blockout requirements
    
    columns:
      - name: appointment_type_id
        description: >
          Primary key - Unique identifier for each appointment type (maps to AppointmentTypeNum in OpenDental).
          Special case: appointment_type_id = 0 represents 'None' type, a valid appointment 
          that hasn't had specific details appended to it yet. This is not missing data 
          but a legitimate appointment categorization.
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
          - accepted_values:
              values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
      
      - name: appointment_type_name
        description: >
          Display name of the appointment type shown to users in scheduling interfaces 
          (maps to AppointmentTypeName in OpenDental). Names like 'zzzzzzzzDO NOT USE' 
          indicate deprecated types that should be filtered out for current operations.
        tests:

        description: >
          Numeric value determining the display order of appointment types in selection
