    description: >
      Staging model for program properties from OpenDental. Contains configuration and property settings 
      for various programs (third-party integrations, features, modules) with associated clinic and 
      security information.
      
      This table stores key-value pairs that configure how different programs and features behave within 
      OpenDental. Each property can be clinic-specific or global, and may have security restrictions. 
      Common use cases include API credentials, feature toggles, integration settings, and system 
      configuration parameters.

      usage_notes: >
        This model is primarily used for understanding system configuration and feature enablement 
        across clinics. When analyzing program configurations, consider that properties may be 
        clinic-specific or global. Use caution when handling property values as they may contain 
        sensitive information like API credentials or security settings.

          Value associated with the program property - The actual configuration value which may be:
          URLs, API keys, boolean flags (0/1), numeric values, file paths, or other configuration data.
          May be null when using system defaults.

        description: >
          Name of the computer where the property is set - Identifies the specific workstation or server 
          where this property configuration applies. May be null for global/system-wide properties.
