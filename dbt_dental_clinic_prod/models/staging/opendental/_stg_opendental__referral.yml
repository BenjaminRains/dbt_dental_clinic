        - Use patient_id = 0 to identify external referral sources
        - Check is_preferred and is_trusted_direct flags for priority referral sources
        - Consider both individual (not_person = false) and business (not_person = true) referral types
        - Use is_hidden flag to filter out inactive referrals
