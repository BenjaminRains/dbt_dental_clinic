    description: >
      Staging model for insurance benefits containing specific coverage details, limitations, and rules for insurance plans and patient plan assignments.
      
      This model captures the complex benefit structure of dental insurance plans, including coverage percentages, 
      deductibles, limitations, and procedure-specific rules. Benefits can be associated with specific insurance plans 
      (template benefits with patient_plan_id = 0) or individual patient plan assignments. The model supports multiple 
      benefit types including coverage percentages, limitations/deductibles, and template/default rules.

      usage_notes: >
        This table contains ONLY template benefits (all patient_plan_id = 0) which serve as default rules for insurance plans.
        Patient-specific benefit assignments are likely stored in a different table (possibly stg_opendental__patplan or related).
        These template benefits define the baseline coverage rules that get applied to patient plans. All benefits are both 
        procedure-specific AND code-group-specific, suggesting a hierarchical benefit structure.
