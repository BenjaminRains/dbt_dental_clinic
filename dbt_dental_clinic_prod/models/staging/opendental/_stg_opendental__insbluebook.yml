    description: >
      Staging model for insurance bluebook entries from OpenDental. Contains insurance payment 
      information, allowed fee overrides, and procedure-specific insurance data used for claims 
      processing and payment tracking.
      
      This model captures the relationship between procedures, insurance plans, and actual/allowed 
      payment amounts. It's essential for understanding insurance payment patterns and fee schedules.
      Data is filtered to include only records from 2023-01-01 onwards for performance and relevance.

      usage_notes: >
        This model is primarily used for insurance payment analysis and fee schedule management.
        When joining with claims data, use conditional relationships due to potential orphaned records.
        The procedure_date may differ from the claim date due to timing of entry vs service.
