    description: >
      Staging model for task history records from OpenDental. Contains historical snapshots of task changes,
      including modifications to task details, status updates, and assignment changes.
      
      Business Context:
      - Tracks complete history of task modifications for audit and tracking
      - Records changes to task assignments, priorities, and statuses
      - Maintains history of task descriptions and notes
      - Supports task workflow analysis and compliance tracking
      
      Data Scope:
      - Records from 2023-01-01 onwards
      - Includes all task modification types
      - Captures both system and user-initiated changes
      
      Key Relationships:
      - Links to tasks through task_id
      - Links to users through user_hist_id (who made the change)
      - Links to task lists through task_list_id
      - Links to various entities through key_id (based on object_type)
      - Links to task creators through from_id
      - Links to assigned users through user_id
      - Links to priority definitions through priority_def_id
      - Links to triage categories through triage_category_id
      
      Important Business Rules:
      - Each history record represents a single change to a task
      - Changes are tracked with timestamps and user information
      - Task status changes are recorded with before/after values
      - Note changes are flagged separately from other modifications

          impact: "Maintains accurate task workflow history"

      usage_notes: >
        - Use timestamp for chronological analysis of task changes
        - Check is_note_change to filter note-specific modifications
        - Be aware that tasks with date_type = 0 may reference deleted tasks or task lists
        - Future dates (2024-11-05) may indicate data entry issues
        - Task status values: 0=New, 1=In Progress, 2=Completed
        - Date type values: 0=No Date, 1=Due Date, 2=Start Date
        - Object type values: 0=None, 1=Patient, 2=Procedure
