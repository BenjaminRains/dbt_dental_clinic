    description: >
      Staging model for task unread status from OpenDental. Tracks which users have not yet
      read specific tasks, supporting the task notification and alert system.
      
      Business Context:
      - Tracks task read status for users
      - Used for task notification and alert system
      - Helps ensure task awareness and follow-up
      - Supports task collaboration and information sharing
      - Enables targeted notifications for unread tasks
      
      Data Scope:
      - Records from 2023-01-01 onwards
      - Only includes tasks that exist in stg_opendental__task
      - Filters out records where TaskNum or UserNum is 0
      - Maintains complete unread status history
      
      Key Relationships:
      - Links to tasks through task_id
      - Links to users through user_id
      
      Important Business Rules:
      - Only tracks unread status for valid tasks
      - Only tracks unread status for valid users
      - Task must exist in stg_opendental__task
      - Zero values in source are converted to NULL
      - Tasks must be from 2023-01-01 onwards
