    description: >
      Staging model for system entry logs from OpenDental. Contains audit trail information about 
      user actions and system events, tracking who performed what action and when. This is a 
      critical audit table that provides transparency into all system activities for compliance
      and troubleshooting purposes.

      usage_notes: >
        This table is essential for audit trails and compliance reporting. All user actions
        in OpenDental generate entries here. Use for tracking user activity, system events,
        and troubleshooting. Note that user_id = 0 represents system-generated entries.
        The foreign_key and foreign_key_type work together to reference related records
        in other tables based on the specific log source.

      - name: foreign_key
        description: >
          Foreign key reference to the related record (maps to FKey in OpenDental). 
          The actual table referenced depends on the foreign_key_type value.
          Used in conjunction with foreign_key_type to create polymorphic relationships
          to various OpenDental entities that generate audit log entries.

          - not_null
          - positive_values
      
      # Business Columns
      - name: foreign_key_type
        description: >
          Type identifier for the foreign key reference (maps to FKeyType in OpenDental). 
          Indicates what type of record the foreign_key points to. In this dataset,
          all entries currently have foreign_key_type = 0, which appears to be the
          standard value for general audit log entries. This creates a polymorphic 
          relationship where different foreign_key_type values could point to 
          different tables in the OpenDental system.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - accepted_values:
              values: [0]

      - name: log_source
        description: >
          Source of the log entry (maps to LogSource in OpenDental). Indicates which 
          system component or module generated the log entry. This helps categorize
          audit events by the system area where they originated (e.g., clinical,
          financial, administrative modules).

      - name: entry_datetime
        description: >
          Timestamp when the log entry was created (maps to EntryDateTime in OpenDental).
          This represents both when the action occurred and when it was logged, as 
          entry logs are created in real-time. All timestamps are in the OpenDental
          server timezone.
