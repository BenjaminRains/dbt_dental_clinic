      Staging model for OpenDental code groups that define collections of dental procedure codes for organizational and reporting purposes.
      
      Code groups are used in OpenDental to organize related procedure codes together, making it easier to manage fees, 
      create reports, and control display settings. Each code group contains a collection of procedure codes that can be 
      referenced by their group name, with configurable display ordering and visibility settings.

      usage_notes: >
        Use this model for understanding procedure code organization and creating reports that group procedures 
        by business function. The proc_codes field contains comma-separated procedure codes and may need parsing 
        for analysis. Be aware that procedure codes can belong to multiple groups.
    
    tests:
      - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
          expression: "item_order >= 0"

      - name: group_name
        description: >
          Name of the code group used for display and identification purposes. Limited to 50 characters in OpenDental.
          Examples include 'Preventive', 'Restorative', 'Oral Surgery', etc. Used in reports and fee management.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_utils.not_empty_string

      - name: proc_codes
        description: >
          Text field containing comma-separated list of procedure codes (ADA codes) associated with this group.
          Format typically like 'D0120,D0140,D0210' for diagnostic procedures. This field may require parsing 
          to extract individual procedure codes for analysis.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: item_order
        description: >
          Integer representing the display order of the code group in OpenDental interface lists and dropdowns.
          Lower values appear first. Used to control the sequence in which code groups are presented to users.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
              expression: ">= 0"

      - name: is_fixed
        description: >
          Boolean flag indicating if the code group is system-fixed and cannot be modified by users 
          (0=No, 1=Yes converted to boolean). Fixed groups represent core system functionality that 
          should not be altered.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - boolean_values

      - name: is_hidden
        description: >
          Boolean flag indicating if the code group is hidden from normal user interface views 
          (0=No, 1=Yes converted to boolean). Hidden groups may be used for administrative purposes 
          or deprecated functionality.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - boolean_values

      - name: show_in_age_limit
        description: >
          Boolean flag indicating if the code group should be displayed in age limit configuration settings 
          (0=No, 1=Yes converted to boolean). Used to control which code groups are available when setting 
          age-based treatment limitations.
