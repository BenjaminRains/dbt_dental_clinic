    description: >
      Staging model for OpenDental treatment planned procedures (proctp table). Represents procedures that are 
      part of a treatment plan but have not necessarily been completed yet. This model contains comprehensive 
      information about planned dental procedures including financial estimates, scheduling priorities, and 
      clinical details for future treatments.
      
      Treatment planned procedures serve as the foundation for pre-treatment estimates, insurance pre-authorizations, 
      and clinical workflow management. Once a planned procedure is completed, it may be linked to the actual 
      completed procedure through the procedure_id_orig field, providing traceability from planning to execution.

      usage_notes: >
        This model is essential for treatment planning analysis, financial forecasting, and patient communication.
        When analyzing financial data, be aware that estimates may not reflect final treatment costs due to 
        benefit changes, fee updates, or treatment modifications. For the most accurate financial analysis,
        join with completed procedures in procedurelog to compare planned vs. actual amounts.
        
        Key relationships: Links to treatplan (treatment_plan_id), patient (patient_id), and when completed,
        to procedurelog (procedure_id_orig). Priority and item_order fields are critical for understanding
        intended treatment sequence and patient presentation.
