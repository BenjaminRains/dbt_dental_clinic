      Fee schedule data from OpenDental dental practice management system.
      Contains fee schedule configurations that define pricing structures for dental procedures.
      
      As an out-of-network focused clinic, fee schedules are minimally used in practice:
      - The default fee schedule (ID: 0) is used by 99.99% of patients (32,698 of 32,700 as of 2025)
      - Additional insurance-related fee schedules (8285-8293) exist for system compatibility but have no patient assignments
      - Fee schedules primarily serve as reference data rather than active billing configuration
      - Most schedules maintain empty descriptions as they're not actively utilized
    
    meta:
      record_count: "~20 fee schedules (8285-8293 range plus default 0)"
      data_scope: "All fee schedule records from 2023-01-01 onward, filtered to exclude pre-2000 invalid dates"

        - rule: "Fee schedule types (0=Normal, 1=No Insurance, 2=Base, 4=Insurance) maintained for system compatibility"
          impact: "Type distinctions don't affect actual billing workflow but must be preserved for OpenDental functionality"
        - rule: "All fee schedules marked as global (is_global_flag = 1) for uniform clinic operation"
          impact: "Ensures consistent pricing across all clinic locations"
      
      usage_notes: >
        Critical for analysts: This table reflects a minimal fee schedule implementation. 
        The clinic operates primarily out-of-network, so complex fee schedule logic is not used.
        Focus analysis on the default schedule (ID: 0) for patient billing patterns.
        Other schedules exist for insurance compatibility but don't represent active pricing strategies.

    columns:

          Primary key - Unique identifier for each fee schedule configuration (maps to FeeSchedNum in OpenDental).
          Fee schedule 0 is the default used for 99.99% of patients in this out-of-network practice.
          Other IDs (8285-8293) represent insurance-related schedules maintained for system compatibility.
