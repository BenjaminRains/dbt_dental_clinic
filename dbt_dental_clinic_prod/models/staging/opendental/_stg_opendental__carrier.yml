    description: >
      Staging model for insurance carriers. Contains comprehensive information about insurance 
      companies and their configurations for claim processing and patient coverage.
      
      This model includes basic carrier information (name, address, contact details), 
      electronic claims processing settings, Canadian-specific dental association configurations,
      and various insurance behavior overrides that control how claims are processed and 
      payments are coordinated.

      usage_notes: >
        This model is used for insurance claim processing, benefit verification, and carrier 
        configuration management. When analyzing claim data, always consider the carrier's
        electronic submission capabilities and behavior overrides that may affect processing.
        
        For Canadian carriers, ensure CDAnet configuration is complete before processing claims.
        Hidden carriers are maintained for historical reference but should not be used for new plans.
