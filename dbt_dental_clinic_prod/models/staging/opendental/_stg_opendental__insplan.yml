      Staging model for insurance plans from OpenDental. Contains comprehensive insurance plan 
      information including fee schedules, plan details, settings, and relationships to carriers 
      and employers. This model includes all insurance plans regardless of status, with plan 
      visibility controlled via is_hidden and hide_from_verify_list flags.

      usage_notes: >
        This model contains all insurance plans from the system, including those that may be
        inactive or hidden from the main interface. When analyzing active plans, filter using
        is_hidden = false. For insurance verification workflows, also check hide_from_verify_list.
        Fee schedule relationships may be null, indicating plans without standardized fee structures.
        
        Data Quality Considerations:
        - 57 plans have duplicate group_number/carrier_id/employer_id combinations - verify business logic before analysis
        - Some plans reference deleted fee schedules - use LEFT JOINs when joining to fee schedule tables
        - One incomplete plan (ID 12905) has null carrier_id - exclude from carrier-based analysis
