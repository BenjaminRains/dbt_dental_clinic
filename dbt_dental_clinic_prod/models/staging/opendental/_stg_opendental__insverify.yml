    description: >
      Staging model for insurance verification records. This table tracks verification activities 
      for insurance-related entities, documenting when insurance coverage has been verified and by whom.
      
      The verification process is critical for ensuring accurate insurance billing and reducing claim 
      denials. Records track both manual verifications performed by staff and automated system 
      verifications.

      usage_notes: >
        This model tracks automated insurance verification workflows. ALL current records are 
        system-generated (user_id = 0) with no manual user-created verifications in the dataset. 
        The foreign_key_id interpretation depends on verify_type, so always filter or group by 
        verify_type when analyzing relationships. System-generated records may have different 
        data completeness patterns, particularly around timestamp fields and foreign key relationships.
