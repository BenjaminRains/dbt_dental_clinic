    description: |
      Staging model for sheet field records from OpenDental. Contains information about individual fields within sheets, including their properties, values, and layout.
      
      This model represents the core data structure for form fields in OpenDental's sheet system, which is used for various clinical forms and documentation. Each record represents a single field within a sheet, with properties defining its appearance, behavior, and data storage.
      
      Key relationships:
      - Each sheet field belongs to exactly one sheet (sheet_id)
      - Each sheet field may reference a sheet field definition (sheet_field_def_id)
      - Fields can be grouped into radio button groups for related options
      
      Business rules:
      - Fields can be required or optional (is_required)
      - Fields can be locked from editing (is_locked)
      - Fields can support electronic signatures (can_electronically_sign)
      - Fields have specific layout properties (position, size, font)
      
      Known data quality issues:
      - Some sheet_field records reference non-existent sheet records
      - Some sheet_field records reference non-existent sheet_field_def records
      - Some sheets have duplicate field definitions
      These issues are tracked as warnings rather than errors to allow for investigation and remediation.

      usage_notes: |
        - Use this model to analyze form field usage and properties
        - Consider field types and layouts when analyzing form design
        - Be aware of known data quality issues when joining to related tables
        - Electronic signature fields require special handling for compliance
