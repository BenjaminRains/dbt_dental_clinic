    description: >
      Staging model for OpenDental lab cases representing laboratory work orders and their lifecycle.
      
      This model contains information about dental laboratory work requested for patients, including 
      prosthetics, crowns, bridges, and other lab-fabricated items. Each record represents a single 
      lab case with its associated timelines, costs, and instructions. The model tracks the complete 
      lifecycle from creation through delivery, providing critical data for clinical workflow 
      management, lab cost analysis, and patient care coordination.
      
      Records include both active and historical lab cases since 2023-01-01, with incremental 
      updates based on creation timestamp. Foreign key relationships connect to patients, 
      providers, laboratories, and appointments for comprehensive analysis.

      usage_notes: >
        Use this model for lab workflow analysis, cost tracking, and turnaround time reporting.
        Join with patient and provider models for comprehensive clinical analysis. 
        For financial analysis, join with fee schedules and payment models.
        
        IMPORTANT: Some cases have invalid timestamp sequences (21 total cases with workflow 
        anomalies). For accurate turnaround time analysis, consider filtering these out:
        - Filter by sent_at IS NOT NULL AND sent_at >= date_created for valid creationâ†’send workflow
        - Filter by received_at IS NOT NULL AND received_at >= sent_at for valid lab turnaround times  
        - Filter by checked_at IS NOT NULL AND checked_at >= received_at for valid quality control workflow
        
        These timestamp anomalies may indicate data entry errors or system clock issues 
        during historical data migration.
