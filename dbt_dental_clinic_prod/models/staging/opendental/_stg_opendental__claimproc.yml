      Standardized staging model for insurance claim procedures from OpenDental.
      This model represents individual procedures that are included in insurance claims,
      connecting claims, procedures, and payments in the dental practice management system.
      Each record represents one procedure submitted to or processed by an insurance company,
      containing financial details like billed amounts, estimated payments, actual payments,
      deductibles, and write-offs. This is a critical model for understanding insurance
      processing, financial reconciliation, and revenue cycle management.

      usage_notes: >
        This model is essential for insurance revenue analysis, claim processing workflows,
        and financial reconciliation. When analyzing payments, always consider the claim status
        and processing dates. For revenue reporting, focus on records with non-excluded status.
        Be aware that estimates may differ significantly from actual payments, especially for
        complex procedures or secondary insurance claims. Use in conjunction with claim and
        payment models for complete financial picture.
