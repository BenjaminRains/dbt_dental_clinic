    description: >
      Staging model for pharmacy data from OpenDental. Contains information about pharmacies 
      including their contact details, locations, and identifiers used for prescription management 
      and referrals.
      
      This model centralizes pharmacy information used across the dental practice for:
      - Prescription referrals and medication management
      - Provider directory and contact information
      - Location-based pharmacy recommendations
      - Insurance and billing coordination
      
      Each record represents a unique pharmacy location that can receive prescription referrals
      from the dental practice.

      usage_notes: >
        This model serves as the foundation for pharmacy-related analysis and operational workflows.
        
        Key considerations:
        - Use store_name for display and matching purposes
        - pharm_id may be used for external system integration
        - Address fields should be concatenated carefully due to potential null values
        - Contact information (phone/fax) may require formatting standardization for operational use
        - This is primarily a reference/lookup table with infrequent updates
        
        Recommended usage patterns:
        - Join to prescription or referral tables via pharmacy_id
        - Use for pharmacy directory and contact information lookups
        - Filter by state/city for location-based analysis

        description: >
          Timestamp when the pharmacy record was created in the source system (OpenDental).
