    description: >
      Staging model for treatment plan attachments, which connect procedures to treatment plans.
      Each record represents a procedure that has been assigned to a treatment plan with a specific priority.
      
      Business Context:
      - Treatment plan attachments define the procedures included in a treatment plan
      - Each attachment has a priority that determines the order of procedures
      - All attachments (55,180 records) currently reference treatment plans that are not in the treatment plan model
      - Approximately 49% of attachments reference procedures that are not in the procedure log
      
      Data Scope:
      - Includes all treatment plan attachments (55,180 records)
      - Treatment plan IDs range from 1 to 14,881
      - Procedure IDs range from 869,476 to 1,147,924
      - Note: All treatment plan references are currently orphaned, suggesting the treatment plan model
        may be filtering out all records, not just pre-2023 records as previously assumed

      usage_notes: >
        - This model includes ALL treatment plan attachments (55,180 records)
        - Currently, NO treatment plan attachments can be joined to treatment plans
        - Approximately 49% of procedure references cannot be joined to the procedure log
        - Created and updated timestamps are generated at load time, not from source system
        - Investigation needed into why all treatment plan references are orphaned
