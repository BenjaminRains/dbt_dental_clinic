            Common variations include:

            - Crown procedures (D2740): $126-$818 range

            Intentionally small schedules:

            - Schedule 8285: Used for periodic evaluations
            - Schedule 8290: Used for comprehensive evaluations
            These variations are monitored but not considered errors.

          test: "validate_procedure_code_format"
          details: >
            Data quality issues found:
            - Trailing spaces: 'Smart 1500 ' (11 characters vs expected 10)
            - Mixed case: Product names like 'Smart 1500', 'iO Brush' contain lowercase letters
            - Special characters: Emergency codes like '*EMG+' contain plus signs
            These variations are handled by format validation but may affect string matching.
        - description: "Non-standard D-code formats exist beyond traditional CDT patterns"
          severity: "warn"
          identified_date: "2024-12-19"
          test: "validate_procedure_code_format"
          details: >
            Non-standard D-code patterns found:
            - Letter suffixes without periods: D9230b, D9972Z  
            - Letter suffixes with periods: D8670.auto
            - Single character codes: 'D'
            These are legitimate practice codes but don't follow standard CDT format.
        - description: "D6 and D0 flag validation shows expected business rule exceptions"
          severity: "warn"
          identified_date: "2024-12-19"
          test: "validate_procedure_code_flag"
          details: >
            Flag validation warnings are expected due to business logic:
            - D6 codes: 113 records without prosthetic flags (surgical implant procedures vs prosthetic procedures)
            - D0 codes: 82 records without radiology flags (evaluations/screenings vs radiological procedures)
            These warnings help monitor business rules but are not data errors.
      
      business_rules:
        - rule: "D6 prefixed codes should have prosthodontic flags set (with exceptions for surgical implant procedures)"
          impact: "Affects procedure categorization and billing workflows - warnings expected for surgical vs prosthetic procedures"
        - rule: "D0 prefixed codes should have radiology flags set (with exceptions for evaluations and screenings)"
          impact: "Affects diagnostic procedure classification - warnings expected for non-radiological D0 procedures"  
        - rule: "D0-D9 prefixes indicate procedure groups (diagnostic, preventive, etc.)"
          impact: "Used for clinical procedure categorization and workflow routing"
        - rule: "Numeric procedure codes (category 622) don't follow CDT format but are valid dental procedures"
          impact: "Requires special handling in code prefix analysis"
        - rule: "Flags like is_hygiene and is_radiology indicate special handling requirements"
          impact: "Determines workflow routing and provider assignment rules"
        - rule: "Primary categorization is through procedure_category_id field"
          impact: "This should be used for grouping rather than code prefixes alone"

        Detailed breakdown by procedure_category_id:
        - 622: Standard dental procedures (most common, 677 codes, all numeric format)

        - 74: Preventive services and cleanings (16 codes, all D-prefixed)
        - 301: Anesthesia services (4 codes, all D-prefixed)

        - 548: COVID and pathogen testing (1 code, D-prefixed)
      
      usage_notes: >
        Key usage considerations and code format details:
        
        Code Format Types:
        - Most procedure codes follow CDT (Code on Dental Procedures) format with D-prefixes
        - Numeric procedure codes (e.g., "01354", "02920") represent valid dental procedures but don't follow CDT standard format
        - The code_prefix field extracts only D-prefixes and will be NULL for numeric procedure codes
        
        Special Custom Codes for Product Tracking and Services:
        - Single letter codes (e.g., "D") - Used as simplified procedure identifiers
        - Short word codes (e.g., "Watch", "Clo") - Custom tracking or product codes  
        - Product names with spaces (e.g., "Smart 1500", "iO Brush") - Retail products for patients
        - Custom product codes (e.g., "3Dtemp", "Roottip") - Specialized services or products
        
        Analysis Guidelines:
        - The code_prefix field is NULL for numeric codes and should be handled appropriately in analysis
        - Primary categorization should use procedure_category_id rather than code prefixes alone
        - Fee variations across schedules are expected and normal business practice
        - D0-D9 prefixes indicate procedure groups when present (diagnostic, preventive, etc.)

          test is set to 'warn' severity to monitor these expected mismatches without failing
          the build. Common reasons for mismatches:

          - Procedures that were created before provider records were properly linked
