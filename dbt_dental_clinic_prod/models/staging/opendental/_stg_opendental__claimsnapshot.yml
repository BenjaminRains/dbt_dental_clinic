    description: >
      Standardized staging model for claim snapshots from OpenDental.
      This model represents point-in-time snapshots of claim data, capturing
      the state of claims at specific moments for historical tracking and auditing.
      
      Claim snapshots are created when significant events occur in the claim processing
      lifecycle, providing an audit trail of how claim values and statuses change over time.
      This is critical for insurance reconciliation, appeals processes, and financial reporting.
      Data is filtered to include only records from 2023-01-01 forward.

        - rule: "Fee amounts should match the original procedure fee at time of snapshot"
          impact: "Fee discrepancies may indicate data integrity issues"
      
      usage_notes: >
        Use this model for historical claim analysis and audit trails. Be aware that
        not all claims will have snapshot records - only those with significant events.
        For current claim status, use the main claims table. Join with procedure and
        claim procedure tables using the foreign keys, but be prepared for some 
        historical records that may reference deleted procedures.
