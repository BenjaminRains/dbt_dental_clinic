    description: >
      Staging model for task subscriptions from OpenDental. Contains information about which
      users are subscribed to receive notifications for specific tasks or task lists.
      
      Business Context:
      - Task subscriptions enable notification and alert system for tasks
      - Users can subscribe to individual tasks or entire task lists
      - Supports task collaboration and information sharing
      - Enables targeted notifications for task updates
      - Helps maintain task visibility across the clinic
      
      Data Scope:
      - Includes all active and historical subscriptions
      - Captures both task-level and list-level subscriptions
      - Maintains complete subscription history
      
      Key Relationships:
      - Links to users through user_id
      - Links to tasks through task_id (optional)
      - Links to task lists through task_list_id (optional)
      
      Important Business Rules:
      - Each subscription must have a valid user_id
      - Subscriptions can be for either a task or a task list, but not both
      - Zero values in source are converted to NULL
      - Subscriptions are preserved even if referenced task/list is deleted

            - "No associated tasks (pure list subscriptions)"
            - "Average of 1.33 subscriptions per list"
            - "Maximum of 2 subscriptions for any single list"
            - "Users affected: Assistants, Heidi, Kelly, Kristan, Melanie, Saandra"

          impact: "Maintains clear notification scope"
        - rule: "Zero values in source are converted to NULL"
          impact: "Improves data quality and referential integrity"
        - rule: "Subscriptions are preserved even if referenced task/list is deleted"
          impact: "Maintains subscription history"
        - rule: "List subscriptions are evenly distributed across users"
          impact: "Suggests intentional subscription pattern"
        - rule: "Orphaned list subscriptions have no associated tasks"
          impact: "Indicates pure list-level subscriptions"
      
      usage_notes: >
        - Use user_id to identify subscribed users
        - Check task_id and task_list_id for subscription scope
        - Be aware of the relationship warnings when joining to tasks/lists
        - Orphaned list subscriptions are evenly distributed (1 per user)
        - Most orphaned list subscriptions have 1-2 subscribers
        - No associated tasks with orphaned list subscriptions
        - Affects a small number of users (6) and lists (5)
