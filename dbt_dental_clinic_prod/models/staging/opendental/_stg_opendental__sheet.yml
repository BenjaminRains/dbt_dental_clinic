    description: >
      Staging model for sheet records from OpenDental. Contains information about forms, documents, and other sheet-based records in the system.
      
      This model includes:
      - Forms and documents used in patient care
      - Web-based forms and their configurations
      - Sheet layout and formatting information
      - Document metadata and revision tracking
      
      Data is filtered from 2023-01-01 onwards and is incrementally loaded based on the last update timestamp.

      usage_notes: >
        - Use this model for analyzing form usage patterns and document management
        - Consider the is_deleted flag when analyzing active vs. historical records
        - Web forms (is_web_form = true) may have different usage patterns than traditional forms
        - Sheet type and layout information can be used to analyze form design patterns
        - Note that some web form IDs may be duplicated in the source data - verify if this is expected behavior
        - Be aware that some sheetfield records reference non-existent sheets - verify if these are deleted sheets
