    description: >
      Dimension table containing comprehensive insurance plan and carrier information.
      This model serves as the primary reference for insurance-related analytics and
      reporting, combining data from multiple sources to provide a complete view of
      insurance plans, carriers, and their performance metrics.

      ## Business Context
      The insurance dimension is a critical component of our dimensional model, enabling:
      - Insurance plan and carrier analysis
      - Benefit coverage and verification tracking
      - Claim performance and payment analysis
      - Network status monitoring
      - Employer-based insurance tracking
      - Historical plan changes and coverage evolution

      ## Technical Specifications
      - Grain: One row per insurance plan (insurance_plan_id)
      - Source: int_insurance_coverage (primary source)
      - Refresh: Daily
      - Dependencies: 
        * int_insurance_coverage (core insurance plan data)
        * int_insurance_employer (employer information)
        * int_claim_details (claim performance metrics)
        * int_claim_payments (payment tracking)
        * int_claim_snapshot (historical claim states)
        * int_claim_tracking (claim status updates)
        * int_insurance_eob_attachments (EOB documentation)

      ## Business Logic
      ### Plan Status Management
      - Active status based on verification date and pending flags
      - Incomplete records preserved with carrier_id = -1
      - Historical tracking through effective and termination dates
      - Template benefits (patient_plan_id = 0) preserved for reference

      ### Benefit Management
      - Benefit details stored as JSON for flexibility
      - Coverage rules maintained at plan level
      - Procedure-specific benefits tracked
      - Time period and quantity limits enforced

      ### Claim Performance
      - Metrics aggregated at plan level
      - Payment velocity categorized (excellent/good/average/poor)
      - Approval rates and reimbursement rates calculated
      - Historical performance tracked

      ### Network Status
      - Based on verification date and active status
      - Categories: unverified/expired/active/inactive
      - 90-day verification window
      - Hidden status tracking

      ## Data Quality Notes
      - Incomplete records preserved with carrier_id = -1
      - Missing carrier names handled with empty strings
      - Subscriber information validated
      - Benefit details normalized
      - Historical changes tracked through timestamps

      ## Usage Guidelines
      - Primary source for insurance-related analysis
      - Supports daily, monthly, and rolling period aggregations
      - Enables breakdowns by provider, location, and patient type
      - Integrates with fact_procedure and fact_claim
      - Supports benefit analysis and coverage verification
      - Enables payment performance analysis
      - Facilitates network status monitoring

      ## Dimensional Relationships
      - Links to dim_patient through patient_id
      - Links to dim_employer through employer_id
      - Links to fact_procedure through insurance_plan_id
      - Links to fact_claim through insurance_plan_id
      - Links to dim_procedure through benefit_details

      ## SCD Type
      Type 2 - Tracks historical changes through:
      - created_at and updated_at timestamps
      - effective_date and termination_date
      - verification_date
      - benefit_details changes

      ## Naming Conventions
      - Source columns from OpenDental use original CamelCase names
      - Derived/calculated fields use snake_case
      - Metadata columns use underscore prefix (_loaded_at, _created_at, _updated_at)
      - JSON fields use descriptive names (benefit_details)
      - Status fields use descriptive prefixes (is_, has_)
