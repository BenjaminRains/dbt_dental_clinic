                  Most are single occurrences per patient,
                  suggesting these might be historical or deleted referrals.

          Foreign key to the procedurelog table. Can be:
          - Zero (0) for referrals not associated with specific procedures (typically referral_type = 1)
          - NULL if no procedure is linked
          - A valid procedure_id reference
        tests:

                description: >
                  Some referral attachments have procedure_id = 0, indicating
                  they are not linked to specific procedures. This is expected
                  behavior for certain referral types.

        description: >
          Foreign key to the provider table. Links referral attachments to providers.
          
          Note:
          - As of 2024, approximately 994 records have provider_id references that don't exist
          - Common reasons for mismatches:
            - Historical providers who have left the practice
            - Referrals from external providers not in our system
            - Legacy data from before provider tracking was implemented
            - Referrals created before provider records were properly linked
          - These mismatches are monitored but not considered errors as they represent
            expected historical data patterns
        tests:
          - relationships:
              to: ref('stg_opendental__provider')
              field: provider_id
              severity: warn
              config:
                description: >
                  This test warns when provider_id references providers that don't exist
                  in the provider table. This is expected for historical data and external
                  provider referrals. The warning helps track data quality without failing
                  the build.
