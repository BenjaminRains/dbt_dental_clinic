      Standardized staging model for procedure codes from the OpenDental system.
      This table contains dental procedure codes, descriptions, and related attributes
      for dental services and treatments. Only includes records from 2023-01-01 onwards.
      
      Key business context:
      - Most procedure codes follow CDT (Code on Dental Procedures) format with D-prefixes.
      - The system also contains numeric procedure codes (e.g., "01354", "02920") without D-prefixes.
      - Numeric codes represent valid dental procedures but don't follow the CDT standard format.
      - The code_prefix field extracts only D-prefixes and will be NULL for numeric procedure codes.
      - Primary categorization is through procedure_category_id field.
      - Common procedure_category_id values:
        - 622: Standard dental procedures (most common, ~83% of all codes)
        - 250: Administrative and supply codes (e.g., "Watch", "Bleaching Tray")
        - 73-85: Various clinical note types and procedure categories
        - 540: Specialized procedures (e.g., root tip procedures)
        - 251: Prosthetic and special fabrication procedures
      - D0-D9 prefixes indicate procedure groups (diagnostic, preventive, etc.)
      - Flags like is_hygiene_flag and is_radiology_flag indicate special handling requirements.
      
      Tests:
      - Custom test "validate_procedure_code_flag" checks that D6 codes have prosthodontic flags
      - Custom test "validate_procedure_code_prefixes" validates proper code prefixes
