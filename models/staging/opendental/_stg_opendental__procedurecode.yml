    description: >
      Standardized staging model for procedure codes from the OpenDental system.
      This table contains dental procedure codes, descriptions, and related attributes
      for dental services and treatments. Only includes records from 2023-01-01 onwards.
      
      Key business context:
      - Most procedure codes follow CDT (Code on Dental Procedures) format with D-prefixes.
      - The system also contains numeric procedure codes (e.g., "01354", "02920") without D-prefixes.
      - Numeric codes represent valid dental procedures but don't follow the CDT standard format.
      - The code_prefix field extracts only D-prefixes and will be NULL for numeric procedure codes.
      - The system also contains special custom codes for product tracking and specific services:
        - Single letter codes (e.g., "D") - Used as simplified procedure identifiers
        - Short word codes (e.g., "Watch", "Clo") - Custom tracking or product codes
        - Product names with spaces (e.g., "Smart 1500", "iO Brush") - Retail products for patients
        - Custom product codes (e.g., "3Dtemp", "Roottip") - Specialized services or products
      - Primary categorization is through procedure_category_id field.
      - Procedure category breakdown:
        - 622: Standard dental procedures (most common, 677 codes, all numeric format)
        - 82: Oral surgery and maxillofacial procedures (145 codes, all D-prefixed)
        - 250: Administrative, supply codes, patient items (126 codes, mix of formats)
        - 73: Diagnostic services and exams (124 codes, mostly D-prefixed)
        - 81: Restorative procedures and crowns (102 codes, all D-prefixed)
        - 80: Implant services (77 codes, all D-prefixed)
        - 78: Denture and removable prosthodontics (73 codes, all D-prefixed)
        - 260: Imaging and diagnostic radiology (55 codes, all D-prefixed)
        - 76: Endodontic procedures (54 codes, all D-prefixed)
        - 251: Interim prosthetics and specialized appliances (49 codes, mostly D-prefixed)
        - 77: Periodontal procedures (44 codes, mostly D-prefixed)
        - 83: Orthodontic services (42 codes, all D-prefixed)
        - 75: Basic restorative procedures (41 codes, all D-prefixed)
        - 300: Risk assessments and preventive services (41 codes, all D-prefixed)
        - 85: Clinical notes and procedural notes (31 codes, all numeric format)
        - 79: Cosmetic and whitening procedures (20 codes, mostly D-prefixed)
        - 74: Preventive services and cleanings (16 codes, all D-prefixed)
        - 301: Anesthesia services (4 codes, all D-prefixed)
        - 540: Root procedures (1 code, custom "Roottip" format)
        - 548: COVID and pathogen testing (1 code, D-prefixed)
      - D0-D9 prefixes indicate procedure groups (diagnostic, preventive, etc.)
      - Flags like is_hygiene_flag and is_radiology_flag indicate special handling requirements.
      
      Fee Schedule Context:
      - Fee variations across different schedules are expected and normal
      - Common variations include:
        - Implant procedures (D6010): $818-$4,000 range
        - Crown procedures (D2740): $126-$818 range
        - Periodontal evaluations (D0180): $56-$116 range
      - Some fee schedules are intentionally underutilized:
        - Schedule 8277: Used for specific fluoride treatments
        - Schedule 8285: Used for periodic evaluations
        - Schedule 8290: Used for comprehensive evaluations
      - These variations are monitored but not considered errors
      
      Tests:
      - Custom test "validate_procedure_code_flag" checks that D6 codes have prosthodontic flags
      - Custom test "validate_procedure_code_prefixes" validates proper code prefixes
      - Custom test "warn_new_procedure_codes" alerts when new procedure codes are added to the system
      - Fee variation tests are set to 'warn' severity as variations are expected
      - Underutilized fee schedule tests are set to 'warn' severity as some schedules are intentionally small

                  This test checks for any new procedure codes that have been added to the system.
                  It's important to monitor for new codes as they may require special handling in downstream
                  models or trigger business processes (fee schedule updates, etc.).

          Only populated for codes that follow the CDT format (starting with D).
          Will be NULL for numeric codes (e.g., "01354") and special format codes.
          Used for procedure categorization in CDT-standard codes only.
