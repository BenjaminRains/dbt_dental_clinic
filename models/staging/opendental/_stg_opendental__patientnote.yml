    description: >
      Standardized patient notes containing clinical and administrative information from OpenDental.
      
      This model consolidates various types of patient notes including medical history, treatment plans, 
      financial information, emergency contacts, and orthodontic treatment details. Each patient can have
      one record containing multiple note fields that capture different aspects of their clinical and 
      administrative information. The data is filtered to include only notes from 2023 onwards to focus
      on current and recent patient information.

      usage_notes: >
        This model is primarily used for clinical reporting and patient communication preferences.
        Most note fields are optional and frequently null, so analysts should account for sparse data.
        Emergency contact information (ice_name, ice_phone) is critical for patient safety protocols.
        Orthodontic override fields should be used in conjunction with standard orthodontic treatment data.
