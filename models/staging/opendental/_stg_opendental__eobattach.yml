    description: >-
      Staging model for EOB (Explanation of Benefits) attachments. Contains file attachments for
      insurance claim payments including scanned documents and electronic files.
      Note: This table contains data from 2020-2025, while the claim payments table only contains
      data from 2023-2025. When joining to claim payments, filter for dates >= 2023 to maintain
      referential integrity.
      Note: Relationship test warnings may occur for EOB attachments referencing claim payments with
      CheckDate < 2023-01-01 or for attachments without corresponding claim payments in the source.

        description: >
          Timestamp when the EOB attachment was created in the source system (OpenDental).
          This is the same as the created_at field since EOB attachments are created
          when they are uploaded.

      - name: _updated_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the EOB attachment was last updated in the source system (OpenDental).
          For EOB attachments, this is the same as created_at since attachments are immutable
          and don't get updated after creation.
