    description: >-
      Staging model for EOB (Explanation of Benefits) attachments from OpenDental.
      Contains file attachments associated with insurance claim payments including
      scanned documents, PDFs, and other electronic files used for claim processing
      and payment reconciliation.
      
      This model captures the relationship between claim payments and their supporting
      documentation, enabling audit trails and compliance tracking for insurance
      payment processing.

          impact: "created_at and updated_at timestamps will always be identical"

      usage_notes: >
        When joining to claim payments, filter for dates >= 2023-01-01 to maintain
        referential integrity. Relationship test warnings may occur for EOB attachments
        referencing claim payments with CheckDate < 2023-01-01 or for attachments
        without corresponding claim payments in the source system.
        
        The raw_base64 column contains large binary data and should be excluded from
        most analytical queries unless specifically needed for file processing.

      - name: file_name
        description: >
          Name of the attached file including extension. Typically contains EOB PDFs,
          scanned documents, or other supporting documentation for claim payments.
          Used for file identification and organization in the document management system.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_utils.not_empty_string
      
      - name: raw_base64
        description: >
          Base64 encoded content of the attached file. Contains the complete file data
          for EOB documents, PDFs, images, and other attachment types. This column
          contains large binary data and should be excluded from most analytical queries
          unless specifically needed for file processing or extraction.
      
      - name: date_created
        description: >
          Business date when the EOB attachment was uploaded to OpenDental.
          Represents the timestamp when the file was attached to the claim payment
          record for business reporting purposes.
        tests:
          - not_null

      # Required Metadata Columns
      - name: _loaded_at
        description: "Timestamp when the data was loaded into the data warehouse by the ETL pipeline (using current_timestamp)"
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: _created_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the EOB attachment was created in the source system (OpenDental).
          Maps to DateTCreated column. Represents the exact timestamp when the attachment
          record was inserted into the OpenDental database.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: _updated_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the EOB attachment was last updated in the source system (OpenDental).
          For EOB attachments, this is the same as _created_at since attachments are immutable
          and don't get updated after creation. Maps to DateTCreated column.
        tests:
          - not_null
