    description: >
      Staging model for OpenDental tasklist table. Contains task information including descriptions, dates, and status.
      Note: This model only includes task lists created on or after January 1st, 2023. Historical task lists (created before 2023)
      are excluded, which may result in relationship test failures with taskhist records that reference older task lists.
      This is expected behavior as we focus on recent task management data.
