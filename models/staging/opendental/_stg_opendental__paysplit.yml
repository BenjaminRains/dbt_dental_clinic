      Staging model for OpenDental payment splits. Payment splits represent individual allocations
      of payments to specific procedures, adjustments, or payment plans. This model includes
      data from 2023-01-01 onwards and is incrementally loaded.

      Purpose:
      - Allocate income to clinics, production, providers, or unearned income types
      - Track payment allocations to procedures, adjustments, or payment plans
      - Support prepayment and unearned income tracking
      - Enable hidden splits for prepayments and treatment planning
      
      Split Types:
      - Regular splits: Visible on account, attached to completed procedures/adjustments
      - Hidden splits: Not shown on account, used for prepayments and treatment planning
      - Unearned splits: Track prepayments and deferred income
      
      Split Patterns:
      - Most payments have 1-2 splits (median = 2)
      - Some administrative entries (payment_type_id = 0) can have hundreds of splits
      - High-split patterns (100+ splits) are typically:
        * Administrative/batch operations
        * Treatment plan allocations
        * System-generated entries
        * Characterized by payment_amount = 0.0
        * Recent dates (typically within current month)
      
      Common Split Amounts:
      - Most frequent: $31.00, $60.00, $109.00
      - Common refund amounts: -$29.00, -$53.00, -$30.00
      - Small amounts (<$10) often represent adjustments or fees
      
      Business Rules:
      - Each split must be allocated to either a procedure, adjustment, or payment plan
      - Zero amount splits must be valid (discounts, unearned revenue)
      - Unearned revenue splits must have a provider
      - Split amounts must be within reasonable ranges
      - High-split administrative entries require special validation
      - Payment type 0 entries need additional verification
      - Clinic and Provider inherit from attached procedures/adjustments
      - Rigorous validation when attached to procedures
      - Prevents overpayment with warnings
      
      Hidden Split Rules:
      - Must have an Unearned Type flagged as "Do Not Show on Account"
      - Typically used for payment plan prepayments or treatment planned procedures
      - Tracked separately in Account Module
      - Automatically transfer to visible splits when procedures complete
      - Generate income transfers when moved between hidden/visible status
