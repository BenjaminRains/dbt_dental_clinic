    description: >
      Staging model for clinic/location information. This model standardizes and
      renames columns from the source clinic table, making it easier to work with
      in downstream models.

      NOTE: This model is currently not built or tested. The source OpenDental data
      is not being used by the MDC clinic and the ETL script has not been updated
      to include this data yet.
