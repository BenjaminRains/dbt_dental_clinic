      Staging model for RxNorm data from OpenDental.
      
      This model contains standardized drug information from the RxNorm database, which provides
      normalized names for clinical drugs and links to various drug vocabularies used in pharmacy
      management and drug interaction software. This data is essential for accurate drug
      identification, interaction checking, and prescription management.
