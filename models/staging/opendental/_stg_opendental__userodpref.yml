  - name: stg_opendental__userodpref
    description: >
      Staging model for user preferences in OpenDental. Contains various user-specific settings
      and preferences stored as key-value pairs, including clinic-specific preferences.
      Note: Users can have multiple preference records with the same key for the same clinic,
      allowing for different preference types or historical versions.
    columns:
      # Primary Key
      - name: user_od_pref_id
        description: Primary key - unique identifier for each user preference record
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      
      # Foreign Keys
      - name: user_id
        description: Foreign key to stg_opendental__userod, represents the user whose preference this is
        tests:
          - relationships:
              to: ref('stg_opendental__userod')
              field: user_id
              severity: warn
              where: "user_id is not null"

                description: >
                  This test warns when user_id references users that don't exist
                  in the userod table. This is expected for historical data and system
                  users. The warning helps track data quality without failing the build.

      - name: clinic_id
        description: Foreign key to stg_opendental__clinic, represents the clinic this preference applies to
        tests:

                description: >
                  This test warns when clinic_id references clinics that don't exist
                  in the clinic table. This is expected for historical data and system

      - name: fkey_type
        description: The type of preference setting, indicating how the value should be interpreted
        tests:

      - name: value_string

          The actual preference value stored as a string. Can be NULL if no value has been set

      - name: _loaded_at
        description: Timestamp when the data was loaded into our data warehouse by the ETL pipeline
        tests:

      - name: _created_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the preference was created in the source system (OpenDental).
          Since no creation timestamp exists in the source, this uses current_timestamp
          to track when the record was loaded into our warehouse.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: _updated_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the preference was last updated in the source system (OpenDental).
          Since no update timestamp exists in the source, this uses current_timestamp
          to track when the record was loaded into our warehouse.
        tests:
          - not_null
