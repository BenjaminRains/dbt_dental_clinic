    description: >
      Staging model for user preferences in OpenDental. This model captures various user-specific settings and preferences
      that control application behavior, UI elements, and feature access. Each preference is identified by a combination of
      user_id, clinic_id, and fkey_type, with the actual preference value stored in value_string. The fkey field, while
      present in the source system, is not used in our analytics and is set to NULL in this staging model.

    meta:
      record_count: 774
      data_scope: >
        Contains all user preferences from the OpenDental userodpref table, including system defaults (fkey_type 0),
        permission sets (fkey_type 3), boolean toggles (fkey_type 4,8,9,19,21,23,24,26), and numeric settings (fkey_type 20,27).

            The fkey field is set to NULL in this staging model, even though it is NOT NULL in the source system.
            This is intentional as the field is not used in our analytics and its values are not meaningful for our use cases.

            Found 587 records with NULL value_string values. This is expected for certain fkey_type values (0, 11, 12)
            where empty strings are valid, but may indicate missing data for other types. The test is set to warn
            to allow for investigation of these cases.

            May impact analytics that rely on specific preference values. Users should verify the expected format
            for each fkey_type when analyzing these records.
      business_rules:
        - description: >
            Each user can have multiple preferences, identified by unique combinations of user_id, clinic_id, and fkey_type.
            The value_string field format varies by fkey_type:
            - fkey_type 0: System defaults (empty string)
            - fkey_type 3: Comma-separated lists of IDs (e.g., "624,513,517")
            - fkey_type 4,8,9,19,21,24,26: Boolean values ("0" or "1")
            - fkey_type 11: User signatures (empty string or name)
            - fkey_type 12: Placeholder (empty string)
            - fkey_type 20,27: Numeric values
          implementation: >
            Enforced through the unique_combination_of_columns test on user_id, clinic_id, and fkey_type.
      usage_notes:
        - description: >
            This model is used to analyze user preferences and settings across the system. The value_string field should be
            interpreted based on the fkey_type value, as each type has its own format and meaning.
        - description: >
            When joining to other models, use the user_id field to link to the userod model. The clinic_id field is not
            used in our analytics and should be ignored.
