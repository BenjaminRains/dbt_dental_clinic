    description: >
      Staging model for historical appointment data from OpenDental.
      Tracks all changes made to appointments over time as a series of snapshots.
      Only includes historical records from January 1, 2023 onwards.
      
      Each record represents a snapshot of an appointment at a specific point in time.
      The majority of records use history_action=1 regardless of sequence, which appears
      to be the OpenDental system's standard way of tracking changes over time.
      The current state of appointments is stored in the appointment table.
      
      NOTE: Data analysis shows that history_action=1 does NOT indicate "initial creation only"
      but rather "a history snapshot was created" - most appointments have dozens of history_action=1
      records spanning their entire lifecycle.
      
      Note: While created_timestamp exists in the source data, it appears to be 
      in a different timezone than history_timestamp. For analysis purposes, we 
      focus on the chronological order of history records rather than comparing 
      against created_timestamp.

            The test only verifies that consecutive history records are properly ordered,
            ignoring the first record of each appointment (NULL previous_timestamp).
            Created timestamp comparisons have been removed as they are not relevant
            for chronological ordering of history records.

            Informational analysis of history action patterns in OpenDental.
            This identifies various patterns like missing creation records, unusual
            sequences, etc., but these are treated as informational rather than errors
            since our analysis shows that certain patterns we initially thought were
            problematic are actually normal in the OpenDental system.
            To see results, run the query directly with analysis_mode=true.

      history_action_analysis:
        - finding: "Most appointments have 80-95% of their history records marked as history_action=1"
        - finding: "These history_action=1 records span the entire lifecycle of appointments, often across hundreds of days"
        - finding: "This appears to be by design in the OpenDental system - history_action=1 indicates 'snapshot created'"
        - finding: "Many appointments that have history records don't have any with history_action=1, which we initially thought was required"
        - finding: "Large gaps between consecutive history records (60-500+ days) are common and don't indicate data quality issues"
        - conclusion: "Tests and analyses should not assume history_action=1 means 'first/initial creation only'"
        - conclusion: "Missing creation records and large gaps should be treated as informational, not errors"
