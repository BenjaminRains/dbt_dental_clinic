    description: >
      Staging model for historical appointment data from OpenDental.
      Tracks all changes made to appointments over time as a series of snapshots.
      Only includes historical records from January 1, 2023 onwards.
      
      Each record represents a snapshot of an appointment at a specific point in time.
      The majority of records use history_action=1 regardless of sequence, which appears
      to be the OpenDental system's standard way of tracking changes over time.
      The current state of appointments is stored in the appointment table.
      
      NOTE: Data analysis shows that history_action=1 does NOT indicate "initial creation only"
      but rather "a history snapshot was created" - most appointments have dozens of history_action=1
      records spanning their entire lifecycle.
      
      Note: While created_timestamp exists in the source data, it appears to be 
      in a different timezone than history_timestamp. For analysis purposes, we 
      focus on the chronological order of history records rather than comparing 
      against created_timestamp.

              Data analysis shows:
              - 135 records have history_timestamp before appointment_datetime
              - All are completed appointments (status = 2)
              - Most have history_action = 1 (History snapshot)
              - Time differences are small (1-5 minutes)
              - Multiple history records often created within seconds
              
              Business Context: This is actually a normal pattern in OpenDental.
              Staff typically mark appointments as completed just before the actual
              appointment time, resulting in history records being created 1-5 minutes
              before the appointment_datetime. The test is kept as a warning to
              monitor for any unusual patterns, but these small time differences
              are expected and valid.

            Informational analysis that examines whether appointments with significant 
            status changes have corresponding history records tracking those changes.
            Data analysis shows:
            - 2 appointments have insufficient history tracking
            - Both have appointment_status = 2 (Completed)
            - Both are from April-May 2024 (future dates)
            - Both have only 1 history record with history_action = 0 (Unknown)
            - Both history timestamps are after the appointment times
            - Both are missing the initial creation record (history_action = 1)
            
            Business Context: This test verifies that significant status changes
            (like completing an appointment) are properly tracked in the history.
            The two failing records appear to be data entry errors where future
            appointments were incorrectly marked as completed without proper
            history tracking. The use of history_action = 0 (Unknown) and the
            missing creation records suggest these may be system-generated records
            that weren't properly initialized.

            Tests for appointments with completely missing history records.
            Data analysis shows:
            - 10 appointments have no history records
            - All have appointment_status = 3 (Unknown)
            - 9 out of 10 have provider_id = 28
            - All have assistant_id = 0 (No Assistant)
            - All appointments are from January-June 2023
            - All were created in 2022 (between June-December)
            - All were last updated in 2022-2023
            - All were loaded into the data warehouse on May 22, 2025
            
            Business Context: These appear to be placeholder appointments that were
            created but never properly processed. The fact that they have no history
            records suggests they were never fully set up in the system. The consistent
            pattern of status=3 and provider=28 suggests this might be a specific
            workflow. The fact that they were all loaded on the same future date
            (May 22, 2025) suggests this might be a data migration or cleanup issue.
            
            Note: While these records are technically data quality issues (every
            appointment should have at least one history record), they appear to be
            part of a specific workflow for handling appointments that couldn't be
            properly scheduled. The test is kept as an error to ensure these cases
            are properly investigated and handled.

            This identifies various patterns like missing creation records, unusual
            sequences, etc., but these are treated as informational rather than errors
            since our analysis shows that certain patterns we initially thought were

        - finding: "These history_action=1 records span the entire lifecycle of appointments, often across hundreds of days"
        - finding: "This appears to be by design in the OpenDental system - history_action=1 indicates 'snapshot created'"
        - finding: "Many appointments that have history records don't have any with history_action=1, which we initially thought was required"
        - finding: "Large gaps between consecutive history records (60-500+ days) are common and don't indicate data quality issues"
        - conclusion: "Tests and analyses should not assume history_action=1 means 'first/initial creation only'"
        - conclusion: "Missing creation records and large gaps should be treated as informational, not errors"

          Data analysis shows that:
          - ~3,116 unique appointments are missing from the appointments table
          - These missing appointments have ~13,273 associated history records
          - This is expected as appointments may be deleted while their history is preserved
          - The relationship test is configured to warn (not error) for this expected pattern
          - Missing appointments typically have multiple history records (avg ~4.26 records per appointment)
          - Most missing appointments (56.87%) have 2-5 history records
          - A significant portion (24.45%) have more than 5 history records

          Data analysis shows:
          - 82,213 records have hygienist_id = 0 (no hygienist)
          - These affect 2,952 unique patients and 9,941 unique appointments
          - Spans from Jan 2023 to Feb 2025
          - Associated with multiple appointment types and providers
          - Has all possible appointment statuses and history actions
          
          Business Context: This field tracks hygienist assignments over time.
          The high number of records with hygienist_id = 0 reflects that many
          appointments don't require a hygienist, which is normal in dental
          practices. This is similar to how we handle provider_id = 0 for
          unassigned providers.

          Note:
          - As of 2024, approximately 5 records have assistant_id references that don't exist
          - Common reasons for mismatches:
            - Historical assistants who have left the practice
            - System-generated records (assistant_id = 0)
            - Legacy data from before assistant tracking was implemented
            - Appointments created before assistant records were properly linked
          - These mismatches are monitored but not considered errors as they represent
            expected historical data patterns

                  This test warns when assistant_id references providers that don't exist
                  in the provider table. This is expected for historical data and system

          Note: Data analysis shows that many history records (221,541) reference next appointments
          that no longer exist. This is expected because:
          - Next appointments can be deleted while their history is preserved
          - The next_appointment_id is often temporary and changes as appointments are rescheduled
          - This is similar to how we handle missing appointment_id references
          
          Business Context: This field is crucial for tracking treatment plan continuity,
          analyzing rescheduling patterns, and monitoring patient care flow. The high number
          of missing references reflects normal clinic operations where treatment plans
          and appointment sequences evolve over time.

          The records with entry_user_id = 0 appear to be system-generated records,
          likely for automated processes or system-initiated changes. This is different
          from history_user_id, which tracks who made the actual change to the
          appointment. The broader range of statuses and actions suggests these
          records cover various types of system operations.

          - These other missing references affect 1-3 patients each
          
          Analysis of missing insurance plans shows:
          - Most are "one-time" plans that were never updated
          - They're always the first and last insurance plan for their appointments
          - Only one plan (11200) shows any insurance changes
          - All records are from 2023-2024

          Business Context: This field tracks primary insurance coverage over time.
          The high number of records with insurance_plan_1_id = 0 reflects that many
          patients don't have primary insurance, which is normal in dental practices.
          The other missing references appear to be temporary insurance plans that
          were created for specific appointments and then deleted or replaced.

          Business Context: This field tracks when appointments are scheduled to occur.
          The NULL values appear in placeholder records for appointments that couldn't
          be properly scheduled. These records are created by specific users (28 and 57)
          and are associated with provider 28. The consistent pattern suggests this is
          a specific workflow for handling appointments that need special attention.

          Data analysis shows:
          - 1,057 records have NULL entry_datetime
          - These are all system-generated records (entry_user_id = 0)

          Business Context: This field tracks when records are entered into the system.
          The NULL values appear in automated cleanup records where the system
          marks old, uncompleted appointments as broken/missed. These records
          are generated by system users (29 and 57) and don't have an entry
          timestamp since they're automated.

            2 = Completed (appointments fulfilled with services rendered)
            3 = Unknown (requires investigation, may indicate data quality issues)
            5 = Broken/Missed (patient no-show or late cancellation)
            6 = Unscheduled (treatment planned but not yet scheduled)
            7 = Placeholder (temporary state for future appointments)
            
          Data analysis shows:
          - 8 records have status = 0 (Unassigned)
            - All have history_action = 4 (Special modification)
            - All have NULL appointment_datetime
            - Used during special modifications before assignment
            
          - 12 records have status = 7 (Placeholder)
            - Most have history_action = 0 (Unknown) or 4 (Special modification)
            - Some have future appointment dates
            - Some have NULL appointment_datetime
            - Used for temporary placeholder appointments
            
          Business Context: Status codes 0 and 7 are temporary states used
          during special modifications and placeholder creation. They should
          eventually transition to a valid status (1, 2, 3, 5, or 6). The
          presence of these statuses is expected but should be monitored
          to ensure they don't remain in these temporary states.
