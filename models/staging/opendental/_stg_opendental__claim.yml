              This can occur in rare cases when both deductible and insurance payment are applied to the same claim.
              While valid, these cases should be reviewed to ensure they are intentional.

              This test accounts for:
              1. Original claims (received_date >= sent_date)
              2. Resent claims (received_date >= most recent sent_date)
              3. Claims with multiple send dates (received_date >= original_sent_date)
              While some cases may be valid due to data entry timing or system updates,
              these should be reviewed to ensure they are intentional.
