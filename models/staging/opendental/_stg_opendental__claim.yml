              This can occur in rare cases when both deductible and insurance payment are applied to the same claim.

              This test accounts for:
              1. Original claims (received_date >= sent_date)
              2. Resent claims (received_date >= most recent sent_date)
              3. Claims with multiple send dates (received_date >= original_sent_date)
              While some cases may be valid due to data entry timing or system updates,
              these should be reviewed to ensure they are intentional.
