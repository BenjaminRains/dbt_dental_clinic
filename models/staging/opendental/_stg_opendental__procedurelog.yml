    description: >
      Staging model for OpenDental procedure log data. Contains detailed information 
      about dental procedures performed on patients. This model is incremental and 
      includes:
      - All procedures dated 2023-01-01 or later
      - Historical procedures (pre-2023) that are referenced by recent insurance bluebook entries
      - Historical procedures (pre-2023) that are referenced by procedure groups
      - Historical procedures (pre-2023) that are referenced by recent procedure notes
      
      This is a core table that links with procedurecode, adjustment, appointment, 
      patient, statement and other tables.
      
      Key data characteristics:
      - Approximately 101,142 procedures for 4,518 unique patients (avg 22.4 procedures per patient)
      - Includes historical procedures referenced by recent (2023+) insurance records
      - Includes historical procedures referenced by procedure groups
      - Includes historical procedures referenced by recent procedure notes
      - Fee comparison with standard fees shows ~29% exact matches, with ~37% higher and ~34% lower than standard
      - Median fee difference is $0, while average difference is -$39.20
      - Future-dated procedures are valid and represent planned treatments
      - procedure_id = 0 records are valid and represent financial transactions/adjustments rather than actual procedures
        - These records have no procedure-related information (no procedure_code, description, etc.)
        - They have varying amounts, both positive and negative
        - They have transaction dates but no procedure dates
        - They are used for account adjustments, payment transactions, and financial corrections

        description: >
          Tooth surface(s) involved in the procedure. Uses two different coding systems:

          - B = Buccal
          - D = Distal
          - F = Facial
          - I = Incisal

          - V = Vestibular
          
          2. Special Numeric Codes for Odontoplasty (D9971) procedures:
          For procedure codes 523 and 1440:
          - 1 = Treatment region 1
          - 2 = Treatment region 2
          - 5 = Treatment region 5 (multiple teeth)
          - 6 = Treatment region 6
          
          Note: Numeric codes are valid only for odontoplasty procedures (D9971) 
          where traditional surface notation may not apply due to the nature of 
          the treatment (reshaping/smoothing enamel).
