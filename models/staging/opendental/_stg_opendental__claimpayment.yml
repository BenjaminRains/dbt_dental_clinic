    description: >
      Standardized staging model for insurance claim payments from OpenDental. 
      This model represents payments received from insurance companies for submitted claims,
      including check details, payment amounts, carrier information, and processing metadata.
      
      Records are filtered to include only payments from January 1, 2023 forward to focus on
      current operational data. Each payment represents a single check or electronic payment
      from an insurance carrier that may be distributed across multiple claims through the
      claim procedures (claimproc) relationship.

      usage_notes: >
        This model should be used for insurance payment analysis and reconciliation.
        Key considerations:
        - Use check_date as primary date field; date_issued is optional and carrier-specific
        - Check numbers may not be unique across all carriers or time periods
        - Payment distribution to specific claims/procedures requires joining with stg_opendental__claimproc
        - Payment types indicate different processing workflows and should be considered in analysis
        - Negative amounts indicate refunds or adjustments
