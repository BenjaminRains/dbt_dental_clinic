            While there is no direct foreign key from claim payments to claims in the database schema,
            claim payments are logically connected to claims through the claim procedures (claimproc) table.
            A single claim payment can be distributed across multiple claims.

          field: claim_payment_id
          description: >
            Claim procedures reference claim payments through the claim_payment_id field.
            Each claim payment can be associated with multiple claim procedures, showing how
            the payment was allocated across different procedures within a claim.
        
        - related_model: stg_opendental__claimtracking
          description: >
            Claim tracking entries may reference payment events for a claim, though there is
            no direct foreign key relationship. The tracking records provide status updates
            on claims which may include payment information.
