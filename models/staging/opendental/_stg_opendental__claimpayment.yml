          Note: This field is intentionally null for certain payment types:

          - Payment type 465: Sometimes populated (25.93% of records)
          
          The system uses check_date as the primary date field, with date_issued
          being an optional field that is only populated by certain carriers
          (primarily Delta Dental) when they provide this information.
