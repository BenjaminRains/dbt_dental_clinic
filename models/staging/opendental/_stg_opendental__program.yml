  - name: stg_opendental__program
    description: >
      Staging model for OpenDental program configurations. Contains information about integrated software programs, 
      their paths, and settings.
      
      Note: This table does not include two commonly referenced program_ids from the commlog table:
      - program_id = 0: Represents system default/no specific program
      - program_id = 95: Represents legacy communication system
      
      These IDs are intentionally excluded as they are internal system references rather than actual integrated programs.
    columns:
      - name: program_id
        description: >
          Primary key of the program table. 
          Note: program_ids 0 and 95 are special cases used in communication logs but not stored in this table.
