    description: >
      Staging model for the OpenDental scheduleop data. This table creates a link between
      the schedule entries and operatories (dental chairs/rooms), allowing a schedule to be
      associated with specific operatories. It works as a many-to-many relationship table
      between the schedule and operatory tables.
      
      This table is closely related to the stg_opendental__schedule model. While the schedule 
      table defines when providers or employees are available, this table specifies which 
      operatories are allocated during those scheduled periods.

      materialized: incremental
    columns:

          - not_null
          
      - name: schedule_id
        description: >
          Foreign key to the schedule table. Links this operatory assignment to a 
          specific schedule entry (provider availability, blockout, etc.)
        tests:

          is associated with this schedule entry.
