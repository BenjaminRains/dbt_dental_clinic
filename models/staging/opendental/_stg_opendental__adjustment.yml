    description: >
      Staged adjustment data from OpenDental system.
      Contains financial adjustments including insurance write-offs, discounts, refunds, and other account modifications.
      Filtered to include data from 2022-01-01 onwards with basic data quality checks.
      
      Key characteristics:
      - procedure_id = 0 represents general account adjustments not tied to specific procedures
      - These general adjustments affect the overall patient balance
      - Both procedure-specific and general adjustments are included
      - General adjustments (procedure_id = 0) are valid and important for AR analysis
      - Note: Some small reallocations (type 235) and insurance writeoffs (type 188) are missing documentation but are valid business transactions
