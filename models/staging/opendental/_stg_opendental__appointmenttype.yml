  - name: stg_opendental__appointmenttype
    description: |
      Staging model for appointment types from OpenDental.
      Contains information about different types of appointments,
      their display properties, and associated metadata.
      
      Note: Some appointment types have is_hidden = 1 and are not selectable in the UI 
      (e.g., legacy, deprecated, or system types). Only types with is_hidden = 0 are visible
       to users in the appointment type selection window. The 'None' type (appointment_type_id = 0)
       is a valid, selectable option in the UI for appointments that have not had any details
        appended yet.
    columns:
      - name: appointment_type_id
        description: |
          Primary key - Unique identifier for each appointment type.
          If appointment_type_id = 0, this means the appointment type is 'None' 
          (a valid appointment that hasn't had any details appended to it yet).
