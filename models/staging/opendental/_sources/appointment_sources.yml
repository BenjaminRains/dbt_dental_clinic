          Historical appointment data with changes tracked over time. Contains archives 
          of modified or deleted appointments for audit and history purposes.
          Each record represents a specific change made to an appointment, creating
          a complete audit trail for all appointment activities.
          
          The histappointment table works in conjunction with the appointment table -
          appointment contains the current state, while histappointment stores all
          previous states and change history.

          This table is used to manage the clinic's schedule at a high level, separate from
          specific patient appointments. It includes provider schedules, employee work hours,
          clinic operation times, and blockout periods (e.g., lunch breaks, meetings, vacations).

        description: >
          Linking table between the schedule and operatory tables that associates schedule 
          entries with specific operatories (dental chairs/rooms). This creates a many-to-many
          relationship, allowing a single schedule entry (e.g., provider availability, blockout)
          to be applied to multiple operatories simultaneously, and for operatories to have
          multiple schedule entries.
          
          This table works closely with the schedule table - while schedule defines when 
          providers/employees are available or unavailable, scheduleop specifies which 
          operatories are affected during those scheduled periods.

          or administrative work. This table maintains the practice's task management system,
          tracking assignments, due dates, priorities, and completion status. Tasks can be
          associated with various object types (patients, appointments, etc.) and organized
          into task lists. The system supports reminders, recurring tasks, and triage categories
          for workflow prioritization. Only tasks created on or after January 1, 2023 are
          included in the analytics models.
