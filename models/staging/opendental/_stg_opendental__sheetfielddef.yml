    description: >
      Staging model for OpenDental sheet field definitions. These definitions serve as templates for sheet fields, defining their default properties and behaviors.
      
      This model contains the template definitions for form fields in OpenDental's dynamic sheet system. Each record represents a field template that can be used across multiple sheets, defining properties like position, size, font settings, and behavior. The model is joined with sheetdef to ensure we only include fields from valid sheet definitions.

      usage_notes: >
        - Field definitions serve as templates and may be used across multiple sheets
        - Mobile-specific properties (tab_order_mobile, ui_label_mobile) are optional
        - Boolean fields are converted from OpenDental's 0/1 format to true/false
        - Text fields are trimmed and nullified if empty to maintain data quality
        - Some field types (6 and 15) may have zero height and width as valid values
        - Field names may be null for certain field types (2, 6, 7, 9) as per OpenDental's design
