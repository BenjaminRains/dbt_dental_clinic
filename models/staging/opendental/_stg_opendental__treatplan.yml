    description: >
      Staging model for treatment plans from OpenDental. Tracks dental treatment plans including
      procedures, costs, and patient signatures. This model supports treatment planning, financial
      tracking, and patient consent management.
      
      Note: This model only includes treatment plans from 2023-01-01 onwards, while some referenced
      documents may be from before this date. This results in expected orphaned document references.

      usage_notes: >
        - Only includes treatment plans from 2023-01-01 onwards
        - Document references may be orphaned for pre-2023 documents
        - Treatment plan status and type should be validated against business rules
        - Signature data may be in different formats (Topaz vs text)
        - Responsible party is often the patient themselves, but may be a parent/guardian for minors
        - No treatment plan attachments found for recent treatment plans
