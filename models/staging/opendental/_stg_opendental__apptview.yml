      Staging model for appointment views that defines different views of the appointment schedule.
      
      Appointment views control how the scheduler interface displays appointments across different
      operatories, providers, and time periods. Each view can have customized settings for display
      preferences, scheduling restrictions, clinic-specific configurations, and user permissions.
      Views are essential for organizing complex dental practice schedules and ensuring proper
      workflow management across multiple providers and treatment rooms.

          impact: "Proper ordering ensures intuitive user experience for front desk staff"

          impact: "Incorrect settings can make schedules difficult to read and cause booking errors"
      
      usage_notes: >
        This model is primarily used for:
        - Configuring scheduler interface displays
        - Setting up clinic-specific scheduling views
        - Controlling appointment display preferences
        - Managing provider and operatory visibility rules
        
        Key considerations:
        - Views with clinic_id are clinic-specific; null clinic_id indicates global views
        - Time restrictions (only_scheduled_before/after_time) filter appointment visibility
        - Stack behavior affects how overlapping or adjacent appointments appear
        - Provider restrictions help manage complex multi-doctor practices

          Time restriction for showing only appointments before this time (maps to
          OnlySchedBeforeTime in OpenDental). Format: HH:MM:SS. Used to create
          time-limited views like 'Morning Schedule' or 'Before Lunch'.

        description: >
          Stack behavior setting for left/right direction in the scheduler (maps to
          StackBehavLR in OpenDental). Controls horizontal stacking of overlapping

          Flag indicating if only scheduled provider days should be shown (maps to
          OnlySchedProvDays in OpenDental). 0=Show all days, 1=Show only days when
          selected providers have scheduled appointments. Reduces visual clutter
          and focuses on active schedule days.

      - name: _created_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the record was created in the source system (OpenDental).
          Note: OpenDental apptview table does not have creation timestamp, so this
          field is set to null by the standardize_metadata_columns macro.

      - name: _updated_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the record was last updated in the source system (OpenDental).
          Note: OpenDental apptview table does not have update timestamp, so this
          field is set to null by the standardize_metadata_columns macro.

      - name: _created_by_user_id
        description: >
          User who created the record in the source system (OpenDental). Note: OpenDental
          apptview table does not track creation user, so this field is set to null
          by the standardize_metadata_columns macro.
