    description: >
      Staging model for OpenDental disease definitions. Contains information about various diseases 
      including their ICD9, ICD10, and SNOMED codes used for clinical documentation and billing.
      
      This table serves as a reference for standardized disease coding in the dental practice management 
      system. It supports clinical documentation, insurance billing, and reporting requirements by 
      providing structured disease definitions with multiple coding standards. The data includes both 
      active and hidden disease definitions, with ordering information for display purposes.

      usage_notes: >
        This model is primarily used for reference purposes in clinical and billing analytics.
        When joining to clinical records, consider filtering out hidden definitions unless 
        historical analysis is required. The multiple coding standards (ICD9, ICD10, SNOMED) 
        support different reporting and billing requirements.

      # Business Columns
      - name: disease_name
        description: >
          The name or description of the disease as displayed in OpenDental interface.
          Used for clinical documentation and provider reference. Should be descriptive
          and clinically meaningful for dental practice use.

          - not_null

      - name: item_order
        description: >
          Numerical value indicating the display order of the disease definition in OpenDental
          user interface. Lower numbers appear first in selection lists. Used to prioritize
          commonly used disease definitions for efficient clinical workflow.
        tests:
          - non_negative_or_null

      - name: is_hidden
        description: >
          Flag indicating if the disease definition is hidden from view in OpenDental interface
          (false = visible, true = hidden converted from 0/1). Hidden definitions are typically
          deprecated or no longer recommended for use but preserved for historical record integrity.

          - boolean_values

      - name: date_timestamp
        description: >
          Timestamp of when the disease definition record was last updated in OpenDental.
          Critical for tracking changes to disease definitions and ensuring data currency.
          Used for audit trails and change management.
        tests:
          - not_null

      # Medical Coding Columns
      - name: icd9_code
        description: >
          International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) code for the disease.
          Legacy coding standard maintained for historical compatibility and specific reporting
          requirements. May be null for newer disease definitions added after ICD-10 transition.
        # Note: Format validation would require custom test macro
        # Expected format: XXX or XXX.X or XXX.XX (e.g., 521.0, 525.12)

      - name: snomed_code
        description: >
          SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms) code for the disease.
          Comprehensive clinical terminology used for detailed clinical documentation and
          interoperability. May be null if SNOMED coding is not implemented for this definition.

      - name: icd10_code
        description: >
          International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code for the disease.
          Current standard for disease coding used in billing, reporting, and clinical documentation.
          Essential for insurance claims and regulatory reporting.
        # Note: Format validation would require custom test macro  
        # Expected format: AXX or AXX.XXXX (e.g., K02.1, M79.604)

      - name: _created_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the disease definition was created in the source system (OpenDental).
          Maps to DateTStamp column as OpenDental does not maintain separate creation timestamps.
          Represents the earliest known timestamp for this record.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: _updated_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the disease definition was last updated in the source system (OpenDental).
          Maps to DateTStamp column which tracks the most recent modification to the record.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: _created_by_user_id
        description: >
          User who created the disease definition record in OpenDental system.
          This information is not tracked in the source diseasedef table, so this column
          will be null for all records from this source.
        # Note: This column should always be null for this source table
        # No test needed as the macro sets it to null by design
