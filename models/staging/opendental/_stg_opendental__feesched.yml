      Fee schedule data from OpenDental. 
      As an out-of-network focused clinic, fee schedules are minimally used in practice:
      - 99.99% of patients use the default fee schedule (0)
      - Insurance-related fee schedules exist but have no patient assignments
      - Fee schedules primarily serve as reference data rather than active billing configuration

        Current fee schedule distribution (as of 2025):
        - Default (0): 32,698 patients (99.99%)
        - Fee Schedule 55: 2 patients
        - All other schedules: 0 patients
        
        Despite having multiple fee schedules defined (8285-8293),
        they are not actively used for patient assignments.
        This aligns with the clinic's out-of-network focus.
