      Known Data Quality Issues:
      - Fee ID 217113: Decimal point error where $116.11 was entered as $11,611.00 for procedure code D0180
      - Fee ID 219409: Decimal point error where $255.00 was entered as $25,500.00 for AOX procedure (fee schedule 8293)
      - Fee ID 218252: Decimal point error where $255.00 was entered as $25,500.00 for AOX procedure (fee schedule 8292)
      - All three errors follow a pattern of 100x multiplication due to decimal point misplacement
      - Two of the errors are future-dated (2025-01-14) and should be investigated
      - Evidence for AOX fee errors:
        * Exceeds highest legitimate implant fee ($9,000) by nearly 3x
        * Both entries are identical and future-dated
        * Amount is 100x normal fee pattern
        * No other procedures in system approach this amount
      
      Underutilized Fee Schedules:
      - Fee Schedule 8285 (Cleveland Cliffs): Single fee ($56.43) for D0120 only
      - Fee Schedule 8290 (IMAGE FIRST): Single fee ($11,611.00) for D0180 only, contains known error
      - Both schedules appear to be inactive corporate fee schedules and should be excluded from analysis

      High Fee Variations:
      1. Extreme Variations (>$2,000 range):
         - D6040 (Eposteal Implant): $3,978 - $9,999 (range: $6,021)
         - D5725 (Rebase Hybrid): $596 - $4,000 (range: $3,404)
         - D6055 (Implant Bar): $1,110 - $3,500 (range: $2,390)
         - D6010 (Endosteal Implant): $500 - $2,518 (range: $2,018)

      2. Suspicious Fee Patterns:
         - Zero-fee entries found in surgical procedures (D7261, D7270, D7272)
         - Inconsistent minimum fees for implant procedures ($250 minimum seems too low)
         - Large variations in diagnostic procedures (D0474-D0481: $298 - $999)
         - Overdentures showing significant variation (D5863/D5865: $934 - $2,600)

      3. Fee Standardization Needed:
         - Implant crown fees vary from $250 to $1,900 (D6059-D6066)
         - Basic crown fees range from $126 to $1,288 (D2740)
         - Consider implementing procedure-specific fee ranges based on complexity
