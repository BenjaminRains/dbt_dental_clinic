          Note:
          - As of 2024, approximately 57 records have provider_id references that don't exist
          - Common reasons for mismatches:
            - Historical providers who have left the practice
            - System users (provider_id = 0) for automated processes
            - Users created before provider records were properly linked
            - Legacy data from before provider tracking was implemented
          - These mismatches are monitored but not considered errors as they represent
            expected historical data patterns
        tests:
          - relationships:
              to: ref('stg_opendental__provider')

                  This test warns when provider_id references providers that don't exist
                  in the provider table. This is expected for historical data and system
                  users. The warning helps track data quality without failing the build.
