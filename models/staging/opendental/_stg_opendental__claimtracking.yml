            Each claim tracking entry is directly associated with a specific claim through the claim_id field.
            Multiple tracking entries can exist for a single claim, providing a chronological history of
            claim status updates, communications, and processing events.

          description: >
            While there is no direct foreign key between claim tracking and claim payments, tracking entries 
            often document payment-related activities for a claim. The connection is indirect, through the 
            common claim_id that both tracking entries and claim procedures reference.

          through_field: claim_id
          description: >
            Claim tracking entries and claim procedures are indirectly related through their common claim_id field.
            Tracking entries may document status updates or issues related to specific procedures within a claim,
            though there is no direct database relationship between these tables.
