    description: >
      Standardized staging model for claim tracking events from OpenDental.
      This model represents the audit trail of events and status changes for insurance claims,
      providing a historical record of claim processing activities including status updates,
      error tracking, and communication events. Each record represents a single tracking
      event in the lifecycle of an insurance claim.

      usage_notes: >
        This model provides the complete audit trail for insurance claim processing.
        Use this data to understand claim status changes, identify processing bottlenecks,
        and track error patterns. When analyzing claim timelines, join with stg_opendental__claim
        to get claim details. Note that some historical tracking entries may reference
        claims that no longer exist due to data cleanup processes. The tracking_type field
        categorizes different types of events (status changes, errors, communications).

      - name: tracking_definition_id
        description: >
          Foreign key to the tracking definition (maps to TrackingDefNum in OpenDental).
          Defines the type or category of tracking event being recorded.
          Links to predefined tracking definitions that categorize different types of claim events.

              where: "tracking_definition_id is not null"

      - name: tracking_error_definition_id
        description: >
          Foreign key to the tracking error definition (maps to TrackingErrorDefNum in OpenDental).
          Used when the tracking entry represents an error condition or problem with claim processing.

              where: "tracking_error_definition_id is not null"

      - name: entry_timestamp
        description: >
          Timestamp when this tracking entry was created (maps to DateTimeEntry in OpenDental).
          Represents the actual time when the tracked event occurred in the claim processing workflow.
          Critical for understanding the chronological sequence of claim events.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
              expression: ">= '2023-01-01'"
          - dbt_utils.expression_is_true:
              expression: "<= current_timestamp"

      - name: tracking_type
        description: >
          Type of tracking event being recorded (maps to TrackingType in OpenDental).
          Categorizes the nature of the tracking entry (e.g., status change, error, note, communication).
          Values include various predefined types that help classify different kinds of claim events.

      - name: note
        description: >
          Additional notes or details about the tracking event (maps to Note in OpenDental).
          Free-text field containing human-readable details about what occurred during this tracking event.
          May include error messages, status descriptions, or other relevant information.

      - name: _loaded_at
        description: "Timestamp when the data was loaded into the data warehouse by the ETL pipeline (using current_timestamp)"
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: _created_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the tracking entry was created in OpenDental (maps to DateTimeEntry).
          Represents when this specific tracking event was originally recorded in the source system.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: _updated_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the tracking entry was last updated in OpenDental (maps to DateTimeEntry).
          For tracking entries, this typically matches _created_at since tracking events are usually immutable once created.
        tests:
          - not_null

    tests:
      - relationships_with_third_table:
          to: ref('stg_opendental__claim')

          field: claim_id
          description: >
            Each claim tracking entry is directly associated with a specific claim through the claim_id field.
            Multiple tracking entries can exist for a single claim, providing a chronological history of
            claim status updates, communications, and processing events. Note: Some historical records
            may reference claims that no longer exist in the system.
        
        - related_model: stg_opendental__claimpayment
          description: >
            While there is no direct foreign key between claim tracking and claim payments, tracking entries 
            often document payment-related activities for a claim. The connection is indirect, through the 
            common claim_id that both tracking entries and claim procedures reference.
        
        - related_model: stg_opendental__claimproc
          through_field: claim_id
          description: >
            Claim tracking entries and claim procedures are indirectly related through their common claim_id field.
            Tracking entries may document status updates or issues related to specific procedures within a claim,
            though there is no direct database relationship between these tables.
