      Staging model for insurance bluebook log entries. Contains historical tracking 
      of allowed fee changes for claim procedures. Note that this model contains two types of records:
      - UCR Fee records that don't correspond to actual claim procedures
      - Allowed fee records from received claims that link to claim procedures
      
      The model includes entries from 2023-01-01 onwards, and their relationships to 
      both recent and historical procedures are maintained.
