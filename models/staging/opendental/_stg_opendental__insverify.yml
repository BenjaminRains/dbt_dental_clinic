      Staging model for insurance verification records. This table tracks verification activities for insurance-related entities.
      
      **Data Quality Note**: The relationships test is currently warning with 218 records that exist in this table but do not have corresponding history records in insverifyhist. These records show patterns of automated verification creation (user_id = 0) with a 3-12 day gap before subscriber creation. See docs/data_quality/insurance_verification_orphaned_verification_records.md for detailed analysis. This is expected behavior for system-generated records.

          Foreign key that can reference different entities based on verify_type:
          - When verify_type = 1, references inssub.inssub_id (95% match rate)
          - When verify_type = 2, references another entity (62% match rate with inssub)
          
          **Data Quality Note**: The relationships_where test for Type 1 verifications is currently
           warning with 283 records. Analysis shows these are all system-generated records 
           (user_id = 0) with a consistent timestamp pattern (1-hour-1-minute gap between
            _created_at and _updated_at). Some records have old creation dates (2020, 2022) but
             recent verification dates (2023). This is expected behavior for system-generated records.

          **Data Quality Note**: The not_null test is currently warning with 1,094 records. 
          Analysis shows these are all system-generated records (user_id = 0) with 
          last_verified_date populated but null entry_timestamp. This is expected behavior
          for system-generated records.
