    description: >
      Staging model for insurance plans. Contains all insurance plans from the source system,
      including historical and inactive plans. This ensures we have access to all plans that
      might be referenced by other models, even if they are no longer active.
      
      Plan status is tracked through several flags:
      - is_hidden: Administrative visibility flag
      - hide_from_verify_list: Controls whether the plan appears in verification lists
      
      For filtering active plans in downstream models, consider:
      - Using is_hidden = FALSE to exclude administratively hidden plans
      - Using hide_from_verify_list = FALSE to exclude plans not meant for verification
      - Combining with other status indicators as needed
      
      Note: Group numbers can have legitimate duplicates across different scenarios:
      - Federal agency programs (e.g., 104, 105)
      - Corporate plans across multiple carriers
      - Medicare/program-specific numbers
      - Industry-specific group numbers
