    columns:
      - name: insurance_plan_id
        description: Unique identifier for the insurance plan record.
        tests:
          - unique

      - name: group_number
        description: |
          Insurance group number that may be shared across multiple records. 
          Business rules:
          - Multiple carriers may be associated with the same group number (e.g., US Steel group 836357100 has 4 carriers)
          - Empty group numbers are allowed for certain carriers (e.g., carrier 2163 with employer_id 0)
          - Group numbers should be case-insensitive for matching purposes
        tests:
          - not_null

          Identifier for the insurance carrier. Multiple carriers may be associated with the same group number.
          Business rules:

              row_condition: "group_number = '836357100'"
              severity: warn

      - name: employer_id
        description: |
          Identifier for the employer associated with the insurance plan.
          Business rules:
          - Some records have employer_id = 0 (system-generated or placeholder records)
          - Multiple employer_ids may exist for the same group number
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_be_in_set:

              severity: warn

      - name: group_name
        description: |
          Name of the insurance group. May have case variations and formatting differences.
          Business rules:
          - Case-insensitive matching should be used (e.g., "UPS" vs "Ups")
          - Minor formatting differences are allowed (e.g., "Saco Industries, Inc." vs "Saco Industries,Inc.")
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_be_in_set:
              column_name: group_name

      - name: manual_fee_schedule_id
        description: |
          Identifier for the fee schedule associated with the plan.
          Business rules:
          - Different fee schedules may exist for the same group (e.g., US Steel has fee schedule 8278)
          - Some records have manual_fee_schedule_id = 0 (default or unspecified)
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_be_in_set:
              column_name: manual_fee_schedule_id

      - name: has_ppo_subst_writeoffs
        description: |
          Flag indicating if the plan has PPO substitution writeoffs.
          Business rules:
          - Some groups have multiple records with different PPO settings
          - This may indicate different plan types or coverage levels
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_be_in_set:

              severity: warn

      - name: is_hidden
        description: |
          Flag indicating if the record is hidden from normal view.
          Business rules:
          - Some groups have both hidden and visible records
          - Hidden status may affect claims processing
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_be_in_set:
              column_name: is_hidden

      - name: created_at
        description: |
          Timestamp when the record was created.
          Business rules:
          - ~71% of records have NULL created_at dates, primarily from a bulk update on 2024-12-18
          - These NULL values likely represent imported or migrated records where original creation dates were not preserved
          - Valid dates start from 2020-04-27
          - Some records have future update dates (2025) suggesting planned insurance plans
        tests:
          - not_null:
              severity: warn
          - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_be_between:

      - name: updated_at
        description: |
          Timestamp when the record was last updated.
          Business rules:
          - Most records were updated on 2024-12-18
          - Some records have future update dates (2025)
          - Future dates may indicate planned insurance plans
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_be_between:
              column_name: updated_at

              severity: warn

    tests:
      - dbt_expectations.expect_compound_columns_to_be_unique:
          column_list: [group_number, carrier_id, employer_id]
          severity: warn
          description: |
            Multiple records may exist for the same group/carrier/employer combination due to:
            - Different name variations (e.g., "US Steel" vs "United States Steel")
            - Case sensitivity differences
            - Historical name changes
            - Multiple carriers for the same group (e.g., US Steel has carriers 1459, 2014, 2121)
            - Empty group numbers for certain carriers (e.g., carrier 2163)
