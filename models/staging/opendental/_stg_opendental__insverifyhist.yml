      Staging model for insurance verification history records. This model tracks the history
      of insurance verification activities.
      
      Data Quality Note: There are 1,987 history records without corresponding verification records.
       These are primarily created by users 57 and 9282 and show patterns of sequential
       verification activities. This is expected behavior for certain verification workflows.
       See docs/data_quality/insurance_verification_orphaned_records.md for analysis.

    columns:
      - name: insurance_verify_history_id

      - name: insurance_verify_id
        description: >
          Foreign key to the insurance verification record.
          
          Data Quality Note: The relationships test is warning with 1,987 history records that do
           not have corresponding verification records. These records show patterns of sequential
            verification activities and are primarily created by users 57 and 9282. 
            This is expected behavior for certain verification workflows.
            See docs/data_quality/insurance_verification_orphaned_records.md for detailed analysis.

                  This test verifies that every history record has a corresponding verification record.
                  Note: Some history records may not have corresponding verification records due to
                  specific verification workflows. This is expected behavior.
                  See docs/data_quality/insurance_verification_orphaned_records.md for analysis.

      - name: foreign_key_id
        description: >
          Foreign key to the related record (subscriber or plan).
          
          Data Quality Note: The relationships test is warning with 1,946 history records that do
           not have corresponding verification records. These records show patterns of sequential
            verification activities and are primarily created by users 57 and 9282. 
            This is expected behavior for certain verification workflows.
            See docs/data_quality/insurance_verification_orphaned_records.md for detailed analysis.
            
            Additionally, the insurance verification test is warning with 2 records where
            the foreign_key_id does not match the expected inssub_id pattern. These may be
            edge cases in the verification workflow that require further investigation.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: last_verified_date
        description: >
          Date when the verification was last performed.
          
          Data Quality Note: The not_null test is warning with 18 records where last_verified_date
           is null. These may be records where verification has not been performed yet.
           This is expected behavior for pending verifications.
        tests:
          - not_null:
              config:
                severity: warn
                description: >
                  This test verifies that every history record has a verification date.
                  Note: Some records may have null last_verified_date if verification
                  has not been performed yet. This is expected behavior.

      - name: last_assigned_date
        description: >
          Date when the verification was last assigned.
          
          Data Quality Note: The not_null test is failing with 19,613 records where last_assigned_date
           is null. Analysis shows these are all system-generated records (user_id = 0) created by
           verify users 9282 (11,971 records) and 57 (6,970 records), with dates ranging from
           2020-04-28 to 2025-02-28. This appears to be expected behavior for system-generated
           verification records, particularly those with future verification dates.
          
          The relationships test is warning with 17 history records where the last_assigned_date
           does not match the corresponding verification record. This is expected behavior as
           verification records store target dates while history records track actual verification dates.
        tests:
          - not_null:
              config:
                description: >
                  This test verifies that every history record has an assignment date.
                  Note: 19,613 system-generated records (user_id = 0) have null last_assigned_date.
                  These are primarily created by verify users 9282 and 57, with dates ranging
                  from 2020 to 2025. This appears to be expected behavior for system-generated
                  verification records.

      - name: entry_timestamp
        description: >
          Timestamp when the history record was created.
          
          Data Quality Note: The not_null test is failing with 6,975 records where entry_timestamp
           is null. This appears to be related to system-generated records, similar to the pattern
           observed with last_assigned_date. These nulls may represent records where the creation
           timestamp was not captured in the source system.
        tests:
          - not_null:
              config:
                severity: warn

                  This test verifies that every history record has a creation timestamp.
                  Note: 6,975 records have null entry_timestamp, likely related to
                  system-generated records. This appears to be expected behavior.

      - name: _created_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the record was created in the source system (OpenDental).
          
          Data Quality Note: The not_null test is failing with 6,975 records where _created_at
           is null. This matches exactly with the null entry_timestamp records, suggesting these
           are the same set of records where creation timestamps were not captured in the source
           system. This appears to be related to system-generated records, similar to the pattern
           observed with last_assigned_date.
        tests:
          - not_null:
              config:

                  This test verifies that every history record has a creation timestamp.
                  Note: 6,975 records have null _created_at, matching the same records
                  with null entry_timestamp. This appears to be expected behavior for
                  system-generated records where timestamps weren't captured.
