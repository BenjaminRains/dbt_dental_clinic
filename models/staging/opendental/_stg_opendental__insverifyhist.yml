    description: >
      Staging model for insurance verification history records. This model tracks the history
      of insurance verification activities.
      
      Data Quality Note: There are 1,987 history records without corresponding verification records.
       These are primarily created by users 57 and 9282 and show patterns of sequential
       verification activities. This is expected behavior for certain verification workflows.
       See docs/data_quality/insurance_verification_orphaned_records.md for analysis.

    columns:
      - name: insurance_verifyhist_id
        description: Primary key for the insurance verification history record
        tests:
          - unique

      - name: insurance_verify_id

          Data Quality Note: The relationships test is warning with 1,987 history records that do
           not have corresponding verification records. These records show patterns of sequential
            verification activities and are primarily created by users 57 and 9282. 
            This is expected behavior for certain verification workflows.

                  Note: Some history records may not have corresponding verification records due to
                  specific verification workflows. This is expected behavior.

          Data Quality Note: The relationships test is warning with 1,946 history records that do
           not have corresponding verification records. These records show patterns of sequential
            verification activities and are primarily created by users 57 and 9282. 
            This is expected behavior for certain verification workflows.

                  specific verification workflows. This is expected behavior.

        description: >
          Date when the verification was last assigned.
          
          Data Quality Note: The relationships test is warning with 17 history records where the
           last_assigned_date does not match the corresponding verification record. This is expected
           behavior as verification records store target dates while history records track actual
           verification dates.
