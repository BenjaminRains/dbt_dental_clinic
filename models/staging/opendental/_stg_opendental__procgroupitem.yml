      Staging model for procedure group items that link individual procedures to procedure groups in OpenDental.
      
      This table creates many-to-many relationships between procedures and groups, enabling functionality like:
      - Multi-visit treatment grouping (procedures spanning multiple appointments)
      - Group notes (single clinical note for multiple procedures completed on the same day)
      - Coordinated billing (claims held until all procedures in group are complete)
      - Treatment planning organization (procedures that should be completed together)
      
      Each record represents one procedure's membership in one group. Procedures can belong to multiple groups,
      and groups can contain multiple procedures. This supports OpenDental's multi-visit procedure workflow
      where complex treatments are tracked together until completion.

      usage_notes: >
        Use this model to understand procedure relationships and multi-visit treatment patterns.
        Essential for analyzing claim holds, identifying incomplete treatment sequences, and tracking
        complex procedures that span multiple appointments. When joining to procedures, be aware that
        procedures can belong to multiple groups simultaneously.

          Foreign key to stg_opendental__procedurelog - Links to the specific procedure that is part of this group.
          Used to track which individual procedures are coordinated together for multi-visit treatments or group documentation.
          Critical for determining when all procedures in a group are complete for billing purposes.

          Identifier for the procedure group - groups procedures that should be treated as a unit.
          Not a foreign key to another table but rather an internal grouping identifier.
          Multiple procedures with the same group_id are considered part of the same treatment sequence,
          affecting billing hold status and clinical note organization.
