  - name: stg_opendental__sheetfield
    description: |
      Staging model for sheet field records from OpenDental. Contains information about individual fields within sheets, including their properties, values, and layout.
      
      Note: This model has known data quality issues that are monitored as warnings:
      - Some sheet_field records reference non-existent sheet records
      - Some sheet_field records reference non-existent sheet_field_def records
      - Some sheets have duplicate field definitions
      These issues are tracked as warnings rather than errors to allow for investigation and remediation.
