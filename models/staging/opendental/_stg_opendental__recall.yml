    description: >
      Staging model for dental practice recall appointments and follow-up schedules
      from the OpenDental system. Contains information about when patients are due
      for their next appointment, recall status, and related configuration.
      
      This model tracks patient recall schedules which are critical for maintaining
      regular patient care and practice revenue. Recalls are automatically generated
      based on procedure types and intervals, but can be manually overridden.
      The model filters to recalls due from 2023-01-01 through current date.

      usage_notes: >
        Use this model for recall tracking, patient communication scheduling, and practice
        productivity analysis. Join with stg_opendental__patient for patient demographics
        and stg_opendental__recalltype for recall type definitions. Be aware that
        is_disabled recalls should be excluded from active scheduling workflows.
        The recall_interval is typically in months (3, 6, 12) but can be customized.
