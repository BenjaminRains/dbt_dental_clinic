    description: >
      Staging model for employee data from OpenDental system, containing comprehensive 
      employee information including personal details, contact information, reporting 
      relationships, and employment status flags.
      
      This model serves as the foundation for HR analytics, payroll reporting, and 
      organizational structure analysis. It includes all active and inactive employees 
      with their current status and contact information. The model uses a special join 
      with the entrylog table to determine creation timestamps since the employee table 
      lacks native audit fields.

      usage_notes: >
        This model is essential for all employee-related analytics and should be used as
        the primary source for employee information. When analyzing active employees,
        filter where is_hidden = false. For organizational hierarchy analysis, use the
        reports_to_employee_id relationships but be aware of potential inactive managers.
        Email addresses may be incomplete for older employee records.
