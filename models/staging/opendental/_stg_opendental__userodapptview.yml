  - name: stg_opendental__userodapptview
    description: >
      Staging model for user appointment view preferences in OpenDental. Contains information about
      how users prefer to view their appointment schedules, including view type and clinic assignments.
    columns:
      # Primary Key
      - name: userod_appt_view_id
        description: Primary key - unique identifier for each user appointment view preference
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      
      # Foreign Keys
      - name: user_id
        description: Foreign key to stg_opendental__userod, represents the user whose view preference this is
        tests:
          - relationships:
              to: ref('stg_opendental__userod')
              field: user_id

              config:
                description: >
                  This test warns when user_id references users that don't exist
                  in the userod table. This is expected for historical data and system
                  users. The warning helps track data quality without failing the build.

      - name: clinic_id
        description: Foreign key to stg_opendental__clinic, represents the clinic this view preference applies to

              config:
                description: >
                  This test warns when clinic_id references clinics that don't exist
                  in the clinic table. This is expected for historical data and system
                  users. The warning helps track data quality without failing the build.

      - name: appt_view_id
        description: Foreign key to stg_opendental__apptview, represents the type of appointment view preferred
        tests:

              config:
                description: >
                  This test warns when appt_view_id references appointment views that don't exist
                  in the apptview table. This is expected for historical data and system
                  users. The warning helps track data quality without failing the build.

      # Required Metadata Columns
      - name: _loaded_at
        description: Timestamp when the data was loaded into our data warehouse by the ETL pipeline
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: _created_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the view preference was created in the source system (OpenDental).
          Since no creation timestamp exists in the source, this uses current_timestamp
          to track when the record was loaded into our warehouse.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: _updated_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the view preference was last updated in the source system (OpenDental).
          Since no update timestamp exists in the source, this uses current_timestamp
          to track when the record was loaded into our warehouse.
        tests:
          - not_null
