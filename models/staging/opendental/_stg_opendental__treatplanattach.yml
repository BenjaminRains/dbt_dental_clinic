  - name: stg_opendental__treatplanattach
    description: >
      Staging model for the treatplanattach table, which stores the connections between treatment plans and procedures.
      Each record represents a procedure attached to a treatment plan with an assigned priority.
      Note: This model includes attachments for all treatment plans, while the treatment plan model
      only includes records from 2023-01-01 onwards. This results in expected orphaned attachments
      for older treatment plans.
    columns:
      - name: treatplan_attach_id
        description: Unique identifier for the treatment plan attachment
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      
      - name: treatplan_id
        description: >
          Foreign key to the treatment plan (references stg_opendental__treatplan.treatment_plan_id).
          Note: Some attachments reference treatment plans before 2023-01-01, which are intentionally
          excluded from the treatment plan model.
