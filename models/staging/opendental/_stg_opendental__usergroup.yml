    description: >
      Staging model for user groups in OpenDental. Contains information about different
      user groups and their associated permissions and settings.
      
      This model serves as a foundation for user access control and permissions management
      in the dental practice. User groups define sets of permissions that can be assigned
      to multiple users, enabling efficient management of access rights across the system.

        - Use this model to understand user access control structure
        - Join with stg_opendental__userod to see which users belong to each group
        - Note that creation and update timestamps are not available in source
        - All timestamps are in UTC
