  - name: stg_opendental__usergroupattach
    description: >
      Staging model for user group attachments in OpenDental. Contains information about
      which users belong to which security groups, enabling role-based access control.
    columns:
      # Primary Key
      - name: user_group_attach_id
        description: Primary key - unique identifier for each user group attachment
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      
      # Foreign Keys
      - name: user_id
        description: Foreign key to stg_opendental__userod, represents the user being assigned to a group
        tests:

              to: ref('stg_opendental__userod')
              field: user_id

                description: >
                  This test warns when user_id references users that don't exist
                  in the userod table. This is expected for historical data and system
                  users. The warning helps track data quality without failing the build.

                  This test warns when user_group_id references user groups that don't exist
                  in the usergroup table. This is expected for historical data and system

        description: Timestamp when the data was loaded into the data warehouse by the ETL pipeline
        tests:

      - name: _created_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the user group attachment was created in the source system (OpenDental).
          Since no creation timestamp exists in the source, this uses current_timestamp.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: _updated_at
        description: >
          Timestamp when the user group attachment was last updated in the source system (OpenDental).
          Since no update timestamp exists in the source, this uses current_timestamp.
        tests:
          - not_null
