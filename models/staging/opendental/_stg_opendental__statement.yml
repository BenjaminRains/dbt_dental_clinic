    description: >
      Staging model for statement records from OpenDental. Contains information about patient statements, including their content, status, and delivery details.
      
      Known Data Quality Issues:
      - There are 25 statement records that reference non-existent documents (document_id points to missing records in the document table)
      - This is tracked as a warning rather than an error to allow the pipeline to continue running
      - These orphaned records may affect document retrieval and statement history tracking
