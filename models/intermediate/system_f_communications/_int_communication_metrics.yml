    description: >
      Comprehensive communication metrics model that aggregates and analyzes patient
      communication patterns and effectiveness. This model serves as the analytical foundation
      for evaluating communication strategies, staff performance, and patient engagement metrics.

      Grain: One row per unique combination of date, user, communication type, direction, and category.
      Each record represents aggregated metrics for a specific communication segment, enabling
      multi-dimensional analysis of communication effectiveness across different parameters.

      Key features:
      - Aggregates communication volumes by type, direction, and category
      - Tracks success and failure rates across different communication channels
      - Measures response rates for outbound communications
      - Calculates conversion rates for communications leading to appointments
      - Monitors average call durations for phone communications
      - Enables time-based trend analysis of communication patterns
      - Provides user/staff level performance metrics
      - Supports communication effectiveness reporting

      Data Sources:
      - int_patient_communications_base: Primary source for all communication events
      - stg_opendental__appointment: Used for linking communications to appointment outcomes
      - stg_opendental__userod: Used for user information and attribution
      - stg_opendental__commlog: Raw communication data for additional context

      Business rules:
      - Success determined by communication outcome (confirmed/completed = success)
      - Failed communications include those with no_answer or cancelled outcomes
      - Response rate calculated only for outbound communications
      - Conversion rate measures communications that resulted in scheduled appointments
      - Duration metrics only applicable to phone communications
      - Metrics calculated daily with user-level granularity where applicable
      - Success rates normalized as percentages of total communications
      - All volume metrics must be non-negative integers
      - Rate metrics normalized to values between 0 and 1
