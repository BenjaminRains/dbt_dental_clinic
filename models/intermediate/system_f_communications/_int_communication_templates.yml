    description: >
      Comprehensive communication templates model that standardizes and consolidates messaging
      templates used for patient communications. This model serves as the central repository
      for all templated messages used in automated communications with patients.

      Grain: One row per unique communication template.
      Each template represents a distinct message pattern used in patient communications
      and can be of various types (email, SMS) and categories (appointment, billing, etc.).
      Templates are sourced from Practice by Numbers campaigns, standardized text messages,
      and auto-detected communication patterns.

      Key features:
      - Extracts templates from Practice by Numbers (PbN) campaign messages
      - Includes standardized text message templates for common scenarios
      - Auto-detects templates from frequently used communication patterns
      - Standardizes template structure with consistent metadata
      - Classifies templates by type (email, SMS) and purpose category
      - Defines variables/placeholders for template personalization
      - Provides subject lines based on template purpose
      - Tracks template creation and update timestamps
      - Supports template reuse across the communication system
      - Enables consistent patient messaging across the practice
      - Uses PostgreSQL's pg_trgm extension for efficient text similarity matching
      - Implements GIN index on content for fast trigram searches

      Data Sources:
      - int_patient_communications_base: Source for PbN campaign templates and auto-detected patterns
      - Standardized text message templates defined in the model

      Business rules:
      - PbN templates extracted from campaign messages with distinct subjects
      - Text message templates follow standardized formats for common scenarios
      - Template type determined by source (email for PbN, SMS for text messages)
      - Template category assigned based on campaign name and content analysis
      - Variables defined for each template type (e.g., PATIENT_NAME, CLINIC_NAME)
      - Auto-detected templates created from frequently used communication patterns
      - Templates marked as active by default for immediate availability
      - Each template has a standardized format regardless of source
      - Template matching uses trigram similarity for accurate content comparison
      - Only active templates are used for matching
