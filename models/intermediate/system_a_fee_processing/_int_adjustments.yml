    description: >
      Comprehensive model that combines adjustment data with procedure information and definitions
      to track and analyze fee adjustments. Part of System A: Fee Processing & Verification workflow.
      
      Data Sources:
      - stg_opendental__adjustment: Base adjustment records and amounts
      - stg_opendental__definition: Adjustment type definitions and categories
      - int_procedure_complete: Procedure details and standard fees
      
      Key features:
      - Links adjustments to procedures and their standard fees
      - Includes definition mappings for adjustment types
      - Calculates adjusted fees and adjustment impacts
      - Tracks various adjustment types and categories
      - Supports fee adjustment analysis and reporting

      Note: As an out-of-network focused clinic:
      - Most adjustments are not insurance-related
      - Fee schedules serve as reference data only
      - Standard fees may differ significantly from actual fees
      - Adjustments often reflect patient-specific arrangements

      Note: Relevant definition categories include:
      - Category 0: Core adjustment types (Adjustment, Discount, Insurance Payment)
      - Category 1: Specific adjustment reasons
      - Category 15: Discount types
      - Category 29: Payment plan types

      Note: Data Quality Findings:
      - Some zero-fee procedures have non-zero adjustments (both large and very small)
      - Some low-fee procedures have disproportionately large adjustments
      - Some adjustments are missing procedure information
      - See stakeholders/adjustment_data_quality_notice.md for detailed findings

      Note: Failing Records Analysis:
      - Zero-fee procedures (procedure_fee = 0) with non-zero adjustments:
        * Common in delivery (D2919), post-op (00040), and denture adjustments (N4102)
        * These violate the zero-fee adjustment rule in adjustment_amount test
      - Large provider discounts on low-fee procedures:
        * Examples: $27,680 discount on $330 extraction (D7210)
        * These exceed the -$10,000 limit for procedures ≤ $1,000
      - Missing procedure context:
        * Records with NULL procedure_id, procedure_fee, or procedure_code
        * Handled by separate rules in adjustment_amount test
      - Reallocations outside expected range:
        * One case of $1,348.40 reallocation without procedure context
        * Exceeds the ±$1,000 limit for reallocations
      - Employee/family discounts exceeding limits:
        * Example: $10,246 MDC EDP discount on $736 procedure
        * Exceeds the ±$5,000 limit for employee/family discounts
