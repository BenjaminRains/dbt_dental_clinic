      Detailed payment information for insurance claims, preserving the complete payment history.
      Each record represents a payment associated with a specific procedure within a claim.
      
      Key features:
      - Tracks individual payments for procedures within claims
      - Maintains financial information (billed, allowed, paid amounts)
      - Preserves payment details (check amount, date, type)
      - Links to int_claim_details for validation
      
      Data Sources:
      - stg_opendental__claimproc: Base procedure and payment information
      - stg_opendental__claimpayment: Payment details
      - int_claim_details: Validation against claim details

      Data Quality Notes:
      - allowed_amount may be -1.0 as a placeholder for undetermined values
      - Some records show decimal point errors in allowed_amount (e.g., 252.00 recorded as 252252.00)
      - See stakeholders/claims_data_quality_issues.md for documented cases and solutions

            While zero-fee procedures are valid in some cases (N-codes, Z-codes, monitoring procedures),
            it is unexpected to have insurance allow payment for a procedure with no billed amount.
