    description: >
      Comprehensive Accounts Receivable analysis model that combines patient balances,
      insurance claims, payment activity, and adjustments. This model serves as the
      foundation for AR reporting and analysis, providing a complete view of both
      patient and insurance receivables.
      
      Key features:
      - Aggregates financial data at the patient level
      - Tracks aging buckets (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+ days)
      - Monitors insurance claim status and payments
      - Tracks payment activity and types
      - Maintains statement history
      - Records adjustment details
      - Tracks claim submission and processing
      - Maintains one-to-one relationship with patients (32,700 records as of 2025)
      
      Data Sources:
      - stg_opendental__patient: Base patient information and balances
      - stg_opendental__procedurelog: Procedure financials and status
      - stg_opendental__claimproc: Insurance claim details
      - stg_opendental__claim: Insurance claim status
      - stg_opendental__payment: Patient payment details
      - stg_opendental__paysplit: Payment splits and allocations
      - stg_opendental__claimpayment: Insurance payment details
      - stg_opendental__statement: Statement history
      - stg_opendental__adjustment: Adjustment details
      - stg_opendental__claimtracking: Claim tracking history
      - stg_opendental__definition: Status and type descriptions
      
      Business rules:
      - Only includes sent statements (is_sent = true)
      - Only counts completed procedures (status = 2)
      - Only counts treatment planned procedures (status = 1)
      - Only counts ordered/planned procedures (status = 6)
      - Only counts in-progress procedures (status = 8)
      - Only counts locked procedures (is_locked = 1)
      - Only includes non-pending, non-received claims (claim_status not in ('P', 'R'))
      - Only includes denied claims (claim_status = 'D')
      - Aggregates all financial metrics at the patient level
      - Uses definition lookups for status descriptions
      - Maintains one record per patient (32,700 records)
      - Record count must match int_patient_profile
