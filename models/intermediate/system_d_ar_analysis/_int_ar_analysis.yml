    description: >
      Comprehensive Accounts Receivable analysis model that combines patient balances,
      insurance claims, payment activity, and adjustments. This model serves as the
      foundation for AR reporting and analysis, providing a complete view of both
      patient and insurance receivables. It includes detailed tracking of claim
      processing, payment activities, statements, and adjustments.
      
      This model maintains a one-to-one relationship with the patient profile model,
      ensuring that every patient has exactly one AR analysis record. All financial
      metrics are aggregated at the patient level, providing a complete financial
      picture for each patient in the system.
