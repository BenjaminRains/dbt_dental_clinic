      Intermediate model for insurance payment allocations.
      Part of System C: Payment Allocation & Reconciliation.
      
      Key features:
      - Handles insurance claim payments and their allocations
      - Tracks payment allocations and status
      - Maintains payment processing information
      - Preserves detailed payment metadata
      - Supports AR calculations and aging analysis
      - Generates unique payment_allocation_id using ROW_NUMBER() over claim_payment_id and procedure_id
      - Validates claim status and payment amounts
      - Tracks partial payments and payment groups
      - Includes bluebook information for payment validation and fee history
      - Tracks allowed fee changes and overrides
      
      Data Sources:
      - stg_opendental__claimpayment: Base insurance payment information
      - stg_opendental__claimproc: Claim procedure information and provider assignments
      - stg_opendental__definition: Payment type definitions
      - stg_opendental__insbluebook: Insurance payment and allowed amount information
      - stg_opendental__insbluebooklog: History of allowed fee changes
      
      Business rules:
      - Insurance claims are filtered to only include:
        * Status 1 (Received) or 3 (Supplemental) claims
        * Claims with a valid claim_payment_id (excludes claim_payment_id = 0)
      - Payment dates are used for AR calculations
      - Payment types are managed through the definition table
      - Payment allocations must be properly linked to procedures
      - Provider assignments are sourced from stg_opendental__claimproc
      - Payment allocation IDs are generated using:
        * ROW_NUMBER() over claim_payment_id and procedure_id
        * Ensures unique identifiers for each payment allocation
      - Bluebook information is used to:
        * Validate payment amounts against multiple sources
        * Track allowed fee changes and overrides
        * Maintain history of fee adjustments
        * Provide additional claim context through group_id and claim_type

      Date Handling and COALESCE Logic:
      - Insurance Payment Dates:
        * Primary: insurance_finalized_date from claimproc
        * Fallback: check_date from claimpayment
        * Used for: payment_date, entry_date, updated_at
      - Procedure Dates:
        * Primary: procedure_date from claimproc
        * Used for: procedure_date
      - AR Inclusion Logic:
        * include_in_ar = TRUE when payment_date <= CURRENT_DATE
        * Ensures future-dated payments are excluded from AR calculations
      - Bluebook Date Handling:
        * Uses created_at from insbluebook for payment validation
        * Uses allowed_fee_updated_at for tracking fee changes

      Common Insurance Payment Scenarios:
      1. Standard Insurance Payment:
         - Status 1 (Received) claim
         - Direct carrier payment
         - Full procedure coverage
         - Bluebook payment amount matches claimproc amount
         Example: $800 insurance payment for a crown procedure

      2. Supplemental Insurance Payment:
         - Status 3 (Supplemental) claim
         - Additional payment after initial claim
         - Partial coverage completion
         - Bluebook shows updated allowed fee
         Example: $200 supplemental payment after initial $800 payment

      3. Partial Insurance Payment:
         - is_partial = true
         - Requires payment_group_id
         - Multiple claims in one payment
         - Bluebook shows total allowed amount
         Example: $1000 payment split across multiple procedures

      4. Denied Insurance Claim:
         - Status 1 (Received) claim
         - Zero payment amount
         - Has remarks indicating denial
         - Bluebook shows zero allowed amount
         Example: $0 payment with remarks "Procedure not covered"

      5. Pre-Authorization:
         - Status 1 (Received) claim
         - Zero payment amount
         - Future-dated payment
         - Bluebook shows estimated allowed amount
         Example: $0 pre-authorization for upcoming procedure

      6. Allowed Fee Adjustment:
         - Status 1 (Received) claim
         - Payment amount matches adjusted allowed fee
         - Bluebook shows original and adjusted allowed amounts
         - Allowed_fee_description explains the adjustment
         Example: $750 payment after $800 allowed fee was adjusted to $750
