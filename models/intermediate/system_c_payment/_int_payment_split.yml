  - name: int_payment_split
    description: >
      Intermediate model focused on payment split categorization and validation.
      Part of System C: Payment Allocation & Reconciliation workflow.
      
      Data Sources:
      - stg_opendental__paysplit: Base split records and amounts
      - stg_opendental__definition: Split type definitions and categories
      - int_procedure_complete: Procedure details and fees
      - int_adjustments: Adjustment details and types
      
      Key features:
      - Categorizes splits by type (normal, discount, unearned)
      - Validates split business rules and allocations
      - Provides split impact analysis and amount categorization
      - Maintains relationships with procedures and adjustments
      - Tracks split validation status and metadata
      - Handles high-split administrative entries (100+ splits)
      - Supports hidden splits and prepayment tracking
      
      Split Categories:
      1. Regular Payment Splits:
         - Visible on account
         - Attached to completed procedures/adjustments
         - Immediate impact on patient balance
         - Rigorous validation on procedure attachments
      
      2. Hidden Payment Splits:
         - Not shown on account or statements
         - Used for prepayments and treatment planning
         - Tracked in separate Account Module tab
         - Automatically transfer when procedures complete
         - Generate income transfers on status changes
      
      3. Unearned/Prepayment Splits:
         - Track deferred income
         - Must have valid unearned type (288, 439)
         - Require provider assignment
         - Can be hidden from account view
         - Common for payment plans and future procedures
      
      Split Patterns:
      - Most payments have 1-2 splits (median = 2)
      - Some administrative entries (payment_type_id = 0) can have hundreds of splits
      - High-split patterns (100+ splits) are typically:
        * Administrative/batch operations
        * Treatment plan allocations
        * System-generated entries
        * Characterized by payment_amount = 0.0
        * Recent dates (typically within current month)
      
      Common Split Amounts:
      - Most frequent: $31.00, $60.00, $109.00
      - Common refund amounts: -$29.00, -$53.00, -$30.00
      - Small amounts (<$10) often represent adjustments or fees
      
      Payment Breakdown Tracking:
      - Fee amounts and procedure links
      - Write-offs and adjustments
      - Insurance payments and estimates
      - Patient payment allocations
      - Remaining balances
      - Overpayment warnings
      
      Business rules:
      - Splits must be properly allocated to procedures or adjustments
      - Zero amount splits must be valid (discounts, unearned revenue)
      - Unearned revenue splits must have a provider
      - Split amounts must be within reasonable ranges
      - High-split administrative entries require special validation
      - Payment type 0 entries need additional verification
      - Clinic and Provider inherit from attached procedures/adjustments
      - Rigorous validation when attached to procedures
      - Prevents overpayment with warnings
      - Hidden splits must have appropriate unearned type flags
      - Income transfers track movement between visible/hidden status
