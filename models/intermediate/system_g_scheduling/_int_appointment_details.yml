      - Records appointment patterns and types
      - Maintains one-to-one relationship with appointments
      - Includes comprehensive provider information
      - Tracks patient demographics and status
      - Integrates with System G scheduling models
      - Provides detailed appointment history
      
      Data Sources:
      - stg_opendental__appointment: Base appointment data
      - stg_opendental__appointmenttype: Appointment type information
      - stg_opendental__provider: Provider details
      - stg_opendental__patient: Patient information
      - stg_opendental__histappointment: Historical appointment data
      
      Business rules:
      - One record per appointment
      - Appointment end time must be after start time
      - Check-out time must be after check-in time
      - Actual length must be positive when check-in/out times exist
      - Waiting time must be non-negative
      - Cancellation reason only present for cancelled appointments
      - Rescheduled appointment ID must be different from current appointment
      - Pattern length calculated based on OpenDental's pattern format:
        * 'X' represents provider time
        * '/' represents assistant time
        * Each character represents a 10-minute increment
      - Status codes must be valid (1-8)
      - Status descriptions must match status codes
      - Required fields must not be null
      - Timestamps must be in chronological order
      - History records are ranked by timestamp (history_rank = 1 means "latest relevant status change")
