    description: >
      Comprehensive scheduling model that provides daily provider schedules and utilization metrics.
      This model serves as the foundation for schedule analysis, capacity planning, and provider
      availability tracking in the dental clinic. It ensures complete date coverage for all providers
      by using a date spine, guaranteeing a record exists for every provider for every day in the
      schedule window, even when no appointments or availability records exist.
      
      Key features:
      - Complete date coverage using date spine
      - Daily schedule aggregation per provider
      - Tracks appointment completion and cancellation rates
      - Monitors schedule utilization and capacity
      - Calculates available time and booked minutes
      - Identifies provider days off
      - Supports schedule optimization
      - Enables capacity planning
      - Provides schedule performance metrics
      - Guarantees data continuity across date ranges
      
      Data Sources:
      - int_appointment_details: Base appointment data with status and timing
      - int_provider_availability: Provider schedule and availability
      - stg_opendental__provider: Provider information
      - stg_opendental__appointmenttype: Appointment type durations
      - dbt_utils.date_spine: Generates complete date sequence
      
      Business rules:
      - One record per provider per day (guaranteed by date spine)
      - Schedule window is 90 days from current date
      - Every provider has a record for every day in the window
      - Days without appointments show zero counts
      - Days without availability are marked as day off
      - Utilization rate = total_appointment_minutes / available_minutes * 100
      - Completed appointments cannot exceed total appointments
      - Cancelled appointments cannot exceed total appointments
      - No-show appointments cannot exceed total appointments
      - Unconfirmed appointments cannot exceed total appointments
      - Total appointment minutes must be less than or equal to available minutes
      - Utilization rate must be between 0 and 100
      - Start time must be before end time
      - Days off are tracked via is_day_off flag
      - Schedule metrics are calculated at end of day
      
      Grain:
      - One record per provider per day (enforced by date spine)
      - Daily aggregation of appointment data
      - Provider-level schedule metrics
      - 90-day rolling window
      - Complete date coverage with no gaps
