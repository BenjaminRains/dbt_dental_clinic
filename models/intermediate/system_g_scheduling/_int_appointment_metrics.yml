    description: >
      Comprehensive metrics model that aggregates appointment data to provide key performance
      indicators and operational insights for the dental clinic. This model serves as the
      foundation for scheduling analytics and performance reporting.
      
      Key features:
      - Aggregates appointment metrics at multiple levels (provider, clinic, overall)
      - Tracks appointment completion and cancellation rates
      - Monitors schedule and chair time utilization
      - Calculates average appointment lengths and wait times
      - Measures new patient acquisition rates
      - Provides daily metrics for trend analysis
      - Supports provider performance evaluation
      - Enables clinic efficiency monitoring
      
      Data Sources:
      - int_appointment_details: Base appointment data with status and timing
      - int_provider_availability: Provider schedule and availability
      - int_appointment_schedule: Schedule patterns and blocks
      - stg_opendental__provider: Provider information
      
      Business rules:
      - One record per date per metric level (provider/clinic/overall)
      - Metrics are calculated for the last 90 days
      - Completion rate = completed_appointments / total_appointments * 100
      - Cancellation rate = cancelled_appointments / total_appointments * 100
      - No-show rate = no_shows / total_appointments * 100
      - Schedule utilization = scheduled_time / available_time * 100
      - Chair time utilization = actual_chair_time / scheduled_chair_time * 100
      - New patient rate = new_patient_appointments / total_appointments * 100
      - All rates must be between 0 and 100
      - Completed appointments cannot exceed total appointments
      - Cancelled appointments cannot exceed total appointments
      - Average wait time must be non-negative
      - Average appointment length must be positive
      - Metrics are calculated at end of day
      
      Grain:
      - One record per date per metric level
      - Metric levels: provider, clinic, overall
      - Daily aggregation of appointment data
