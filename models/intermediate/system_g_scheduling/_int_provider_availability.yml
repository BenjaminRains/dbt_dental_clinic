    description: >
      Comprehensive provider availability model that tracks and calculates daily schedule windows
      and available time slots for each provider. This model serves as the foundation for
      appointment scheduling, capacity planning, and provider time management.
      
      Key features:
      - Daily schedule windows per provider
      - Tracks provider days off and availability
      - Calculates available minutes per day
      - Validates schedule time windows
      - Supports schedule optimization
      - Enables capacity planning
      - Monitors provider working hours
      - Integrates with appointment scheduling
      
      Data Sources:
      - stg_opendental__provider: Base provider information
      - stg_opendental__schedule: Provider schedule data
      - stg_opendental__dayoff: Provider days off
      - stg_opendental__scheduleblock: Schedule block definitions
      
      Business rules:
      - One record per provider per day
      - Schedule window is 90 days from current date
      - Start time must be before end time
      - Available minutes must be between 0 and 1440 (24 hours)
      - Days off must have:
        * is_day_off = true
        * start_time and end_time are NULL
        * available_minutes = 0
      - Working days must have:
        * is_day_off = false
        * start_time and end_time are NOT NULL
        * available_minutes > 0
      - Schedule times must be valid time values
      - Model updates must maintain chronological order
      
      Grain:
      - One record per provider per day
      - Daily schedule windows
      - Provider-level availability
      - 90-day rolling window
